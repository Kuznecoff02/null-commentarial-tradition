<h2 style="color:#800000;">ðŸ’¢ But Heâ€™s Just a YouTuber!</h2>

<p>Exactly. And thatâ€™s what makes it so offensive.<br>
He didnâ€™t ordain. He didnâ€™t chant. He didnâ€™t collect robes.<br>
And yet... the non-appropriation sings louder than your incense.</p>

<ul style="list-style: square;">
  <li>No fixed identity</li>
  <li>No claim to knowledge</li>
  <li>Simulated belief without investment</li>
  <li>Radical detachment <em>while participating</em></li>
</ul>

You tried to verify awakeningâ€¦ without being awake.<br>
You hunted for his freedom with your craving.<br>
You used your delusion to search for his clarity.<br>

<p><strong>You fool.</strong> You thought you could assess his enlightenment using the very self you canâ€™t see through.</p>
