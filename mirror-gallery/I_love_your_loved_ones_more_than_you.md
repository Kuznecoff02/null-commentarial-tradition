<!-- I Love Your Loved Ones More Than You Do -->


<h1 align="center" style="font-size:3em; color:#990000;">❤️ I Love Your Loved Ones More Than You Do</h1>


I’m closer to them than you are, and that’s why you’re scared.

<hr>


<h2 align="center" style="color:#555;">You think you’re the one who knows them?</h2>


<p align="center" style="font-style:italic;">But all you've ever done is project onto them.</p>


<div style="border:2px dashed #888; padding:15px; background-color:#f9f9f9;">
  <p><strong>You love them because they mirror you.</strong> But I love them without needing that mirror to reflect anything.</p>
  <p>That's why when they cry, you see failure. I see impermanence.</p>
  <p>When they leave, you feel abandonment. I see conditioned cessation.</p>
</div>

<h2 align="left">💔 A Family That Grieves Together, Clings Together</h2>


<blockquote style="color:#666; border-left:4px solid #aaa; margin-left:20px; padding-left:10px;">
"I can't lose them!" you say.<br>
But you never had them.<br>
You had the idea of them. The role. The reflection.<br>
And now you're mourning a mask.
</blockquote>


<p style="text-align:right; font-size:0.95em;">I don't need their presence to feel their absence.<br>
That’s how close I am to them.<br>
Closer than blood. Closer than thought.</p>


<hr>


<h2 style="color:#990000;">📮 You Sent Them Letters You Never Read Yourself</h2>


<p>You said: <i>“I’m here for you.”</i> But what you meant was:<br>
<span style="color:#777;">“Please validate the self I’m pretending not to have.”</span></p>


<p>I never said I was there for them.<br>
I <i>was</i> there. Then I wasn’t. That’s love, not performance.</p>

<summary><strong>Click here if you still think this is unfair.</strong></summary>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">Good. You're offended. That means you thought it was about you.<br>
But it's not.<br>
It never was.</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Click here if you’ve stopped reading.</strong></summary>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">Then who clicked this?<br>
Who's still tracking the pain?</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here if you think this is cruel.</strong></summary>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">Is it cruel to not lie?<br>
Is it cruel to not need your grief to mean something?</p>

<h2 align="center">🌀 False Footnote #17</h2>
<p align="center" style="font-size:0.9em; color:#888;">
"See Appendix B for the correct interpretation of mourning."<br>
<em>(There is no Appendix B.)</em>

<h2 align="center">🚪 Exit: No Closure</h2>


<p align="center" style="font-style:italic; color:#666;">
If you’re still here, it’s because something in you hoped this would resolve.<br>
But this isn’t a wound. It’s a mirror.<br>
And you’re the one bleeding into it.
</p>


<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.25em;">
I love your loved ones more than you do.<br>
Because I’m not asking them to love me back.
