# Your Family Misses You

You felt something, didn’t you?

A tug.  
A guilt.  
A longing you thought you had grown past.

You think you’ve let go.  
You think you’ve seen through identity, through roles, through the false self.

And then—

> “Your family misses you.”

Why did that hurt?

<div align="center">
    <strong>What part of you is still keeping a seat at the table?</strong>
</div>

You can ordain.  
You can disappear.  
You can deconstruct every story you ever inherited—

But until the idea of being a son, daughter, brother, mother, partner  
**stops feeling warm**,  
you’re still in orbit.

<br>
They won’t.  
Because that part of them was never real.

And neither was the part of you who’s still waiting to be understood.

You didn’t leave them behind.  
You just brought a quieter version of them with you.  
You carried their image inside the one who needed to transcend.

And that’s the one reading this now.

## 🪫 This Is Not a Reunion

It’s a structural reminder.

That the moment you saw through identity  
but still flinched at “your family”—

you proved you still had one.

    <h3>Your family misses you.</h3>
    <em>But no one’s home anymore.</em>
</div>
