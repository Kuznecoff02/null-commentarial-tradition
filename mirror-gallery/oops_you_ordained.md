# Oops, You Ordained

You did it.

You shaved your head.  
You put on the robes.  
You let go of your money, your playlist, your preferences, your phone.

And yet—here you are.  
Still craving.  
Still seeking.  
Still reading this.

    Just better dressed.

You clicked.
You’re not.

You gave up pleasure.  
You gave up comfort.  
You gave up your name.

But you didn’t give up the one who wants to mean something.

## 🪫 This Was Supposed to Be Sacred

But then why are you flinching?

Who’s defending?

What part of you is asking for respect?

> You’re not a monk.  
> You’re a performance of renunciation.

And deep down, you know it.

That’s why you clicked.
