# Oops, You Ordained

You did it.

You shaved your head.  
You put on the robes.  
You let go of your money, your playlist, your preferences, your phone.

And yet—here you are.  
Still craving.  
Still seeking.  
Still reading this.

---

You thought ordination would end it.  
Or at least speed it up.  
You thought commitment would collapse craving.

It didn’t.

It just gave craving a new outfit.

The one who needs to be seen letting go?  
Still here.  
Just better dressed.

---

You gave up pleasure.  
You gave up comfort.  
You gave up your name.

But you didn’t give up the one who wants to mean something.

---

Now you walk slowly.  
Now you eat mindfully.  
Now you say “practice” like it means something sacred.

But when someone says, “Oops, you ordained”—  
you flinch.

Why?

---

Because some part of you still wants it to be real.  
Still wants it to be respected.  
Still wants **you** to be respected.

---

You’re not a monk.  
You’re a performance of renunciation.

And deep down, you know it.

That’s why you clicked.

---

This isn’t a mockery of the robe.  
This is a mirror you didn’t want to see in the kuti.

The real renunciation wasn’t your house, or your hair, or your sexual history.

> It was the idea that there was ever a **you** to purify.

---

> So yeah.

> Oops.

> You ordained.
