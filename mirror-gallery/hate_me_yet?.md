# 🎰 Hate Me Yet?

<em>This page is rigged.</em>  
You didn’t come here to read.  
You came here to react.

<summary><strong>🪙 Pull 1: Maybe I'm Wrong</strong></summary>
<br>
You hoped this would be humble.

It isn’t.

It’s surgical.  
And now your ego’s bleeding all over the page.

<kbd>Pull 2:</kbd> <code>Justification</code>

<blockquote>
“You’re taking it too far.”  
“No one actually talks like this.”  
“This isn’t the Dhamma.”
</blockquote>

Still clinging.  
Still narrating.  
Still trying to be the one who *gets it better*.

<summary><strong>Pull 3: You're Better Than Me, Right?</strong></summary>
<br>

You’ve renounced more.  
Practiced longer.  
Sat in silence for weeks.

But you're still here.  
Reading this.  
Scrolling for a win that doesn’t exist.

## ⛔ Final Spin

You want me to stop.  
You want to be offended, but **righteously**.  
You want to believe I’m attacking something sacred.

I’m not.

I’m attacking the part of you  
that still thinks there’s a difference between being wrong and being real.
