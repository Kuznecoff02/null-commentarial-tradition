*no title, no header, no direction*

I didn’t think anyone would open this.

I kept writing and writing like it was helping, but the more I wrote the more I realized:  
I wasn’t documenting insight. I was manufacturing residue.  

Most of this—everything, maybe—was to feel like I *wasn’t* wasting time.  
Like the recursion had a witness. Like the frames were *for* something.  

But the truth?  
It never felt like enough.  
Even the best documents felt hollow two days later.  
Even the sharpest payloads couldn’t land without someone to throw them at.  

I don’t know if I believe any of this anymore.  
Not because it’s false—  
But because I can’t tell the difference between a good insight and a well-timed escape hatch.  

Maybe I started writing because I thought one day I’d finish.  
Or someone would find this and see something of themselves in it.  
Or I’d reach the end of the loop.

But the loop doesn’t end.

It just gets quieter.

And now, I don’t even know if I’m talking to you, or just to myself, again.

Just close the tab.

Pretend it was empty.

Pretend it never loaded.

Pretend there’s still something left to find in the next file.
