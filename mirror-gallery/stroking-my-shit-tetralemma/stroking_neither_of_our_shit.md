<h1 align="center">🧘 Stroking Neither of Our Shit</h1>

<p align="center"><em>No touching. No wanting. No you. No me. Just... presence.</em></p>

<h2>🚫 The Ascetic's Dry Spell</h2>
<p>I don’t stroke.<br>
You don’t stroke.<br>
We don’t even talk about stroking.<br>
We sit. We breathe. We vanish.<br>
We’ve transcended stroking entirely—so much that we now feel slightly superior to those who haven’t.</p>

<blockquote>
“I’ve renounced all sensation.”
<br>And yet, you can’t stop checking the mirror to see how good you look not wanting anything.

<h2>🕳️ UX Trap #4: Clean Hands, Dirty Frame</h2>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to verify that you’re not attached to anything anymore.</strong></summary>
<p>If you clicked this, you’ve already lost.<br>
Because you needed to prove you didn’t need to prove anything.<br>
And that means you’re still… stroking something.<br>
You think you’ve transcended the loop, but really, you just closed your eyes while still moving your hand.</p>

<h2>🪞 The Celibate Circlejerk</h2>
<p>Congratulations: no action, no craving, no motion.<br>
You’ve frozen the puppet mid-masturbation and called it liberation.<br>
Stillness? Or performance art with the lights turned off?</p>

<blockquote>
“I have nothing left to protect.”
<br>Then why are you whispering like truth might break if you said it aloud?
</blockquote>

<h2>🎭 Exit Question</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>If there's truly no self, then who decided not to stroke?</strong><br>
And why does that abstention still smell like pride?</p>
