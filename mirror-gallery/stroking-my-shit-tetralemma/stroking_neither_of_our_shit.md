<h2>🕳️ The Collapse Frame</h2>
<p>There was never anyone here.<br>
No doer. No done. No stroker. No shit.<br>
You think this is a metaphor?<br>
That’s adorable.</p>


<blockquote><strong>“But… if no one’s stroking, then how do we…”</strong><br>

<h2>🪞 The Self That Can’t Find Anything to Hold</h2>
<p>There’s no practice.<br>

No one failing to arrive.<br>

<blockquote>
“You can’t just stop.”<br>
Why not?<br>
Who says?<br>
What’s left?

<h2>🎭 Exit Question</h2>
