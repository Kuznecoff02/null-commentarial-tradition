<!-- Stroking My Shit Tetralemma - Quadrant III: Group Session Edition -->

<h1 align="center">🤝 Stroking Our Shit</h1>

<p align="center"><em>We’re doing this together. Spiritually, of course.</em></p>

<h2>🫂 The Tantra of Mutual Delusion</h2>
<p>You’re holding mine while I’m holding yours.<br>
We breathe together. We release together.<br>
Each in sync with the other’s grasp on becoming.<br>
It’s not masturbation—it’s sacred reciprocity.</p>

<blockquote>
“We’re co-regulating our trauma.”
<br>...More like co-fetishizing each other's egos in the name of healing.

<h2>🕳️ UX Trap #3: Group Enlightenment Circle</h2>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click here to harmonize your practice with the sangha stroke cadence.</strong></summary>
<p>You just clicked into a circle jerk of sincerity.<br>
Everyone nodding solemnly. Everyone dead serious.<br>
Everyone stroking the same delusion and pretending it’s dharma.<br>
You’re not holding space. You’re fluffing each other’s identities.</p>
</details>

<hr>

<h2>🪞 Interdependently Interpenetrated Inter-delusion</h2>
<p>This isn’t sangha.<br>
It’s mutual mirroring for psychological edging.<br>
You’re not awakening together. You’re scripting group cosplay for “letting go.”<br>
And the safe word? It's *lineage.*</p>

<blockquote>
“We’re building a container.”
<br>Yes. To collect the spiritual discharge.

<h2>🎭 Exit Question</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>If no one was watching… would you still sit in that circle?</strong><br>
Or do you need eye contact to finish?</p>
