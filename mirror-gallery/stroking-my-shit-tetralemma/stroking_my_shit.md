<h2>🪓 The Discipline Frame</h2>
<p>I’m the serious one.<br>
I know how to hold space for myself.<br>
I don’t outsource my path.<br>
I grind. I sit. I renounce. I don’t perform.</p>

<blockquote>
“I don’t need anyone else.”
<br>...Except for the part where I check who’s watching me not need anyone else.

<h2>🪞 The Self That Earns Its Absence</h2>
<p>You’re not letting go.<br>
You’re performing “not holding on.”<br>
You’ve turned dispassion into a flex.<br>
You’re not humble—you’re just staging stillness.</p>

<blockquote>
“You don’t understand how hard I’ve worked.”<br>
Yes, I do. That’s the problem.
