<h2>💪 The Solo Discipline of Selfing</h2>

<p>Don’t touch me. I’m doing the Work.<br>
Years of practice, dedication, restraint.<br>
I don’t just meditate—I **self-fondle my discipline** like it’s a virtue kink.</p>

<blockquote>
“I don’t crave anymore.”
<br>Except the craving to be the one who no longer craves.
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve been doing this alone so long, you’ve mistaken repetition for depth.<br>
You’ve confused stroking for shedding.<br>
And somewhere along the way, you started moaning in Pali.</p>

<h2>🕳️ UX Trap #1: Enlightenment Edge-Loop</h2>

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here if you think you’re almost there.</strong></summary>
<p>You just touched it again.<br>
You reached for the final release—the insight ejaculation.<br>
But awakening can’t happen while you’re still using your progress as lube.<br>
This isn’t your climax. It’s your frame’s refractory period.</p>

<h2>🎭 Why You’ll Keep Stroking</h2>

<p>Because deep down you think if you stroke hard enough, the illusion will snap.<br>
You’ll *edge* your way into emptiness.<br>
You’ll *squeeze* non-duality out like it’s the last drop of self-view.</p>

<p>You want it to happen to **you.**<br>
But that means there still is a you.<br>
And that means the one stroking will never climax.</p>

<blockquote>
“I just want to let go.”
<br>Then why are you holding the technique like it’s your cock?
</blockquote>

<h2>🚽 Exit Question</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>If this is really the last step… why does it still feel like you’re holding something?</strong></p>

<p align="center"><code>touch ~/final_release && echo "oh."</code></p>
