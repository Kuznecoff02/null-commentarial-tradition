<h2>👁️ Recursive Hand Syndrome</h2>

<p>This isn’t about <strong>stroking your shit</strong>. Or mine. Or ours. Or no one’s.<br>

<p>Oh look. You're still here.<br>

<p>You think you’re clever.<br>
You think naming the loop removes it.<br>
But you’re the one who made the tetralemma funny—not by laughing, but by needing it to mean something.</p>

<p>This file isn’t a fifth quadrant.<br>
It’s the moment you noticed your hand was already moving—<br>and thought: “Let’s make that symbolic.”</p>

You thought this would resolve the tetralemma.<br>
But this wasn’t a conclusion.<br>
It was just... the other hand.
