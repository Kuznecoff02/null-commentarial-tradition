<h1 align="center">🫵 Stroking Your Shit</h1>

<p align="center"><em>I’m not touching myself—I’m touching you. For your sake, of course.</em></p>

<h2>🛟 The Savior Stroke</h2>
<p>It’s not *my* arousal. It’s your need.<br>
I’m just here to help you let go... slowly... rhythmically... with full awareness.<br>
You don’t even know how tight you’re holding it. But I do.</p>

<blockquote>
“I don’t enjoy helping people. I just feel called.”
<br>Interesting how that calling always feels so good in the hands.

<h2>🕳️ UX Trap #2: Mutual Release</h2>
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to help someone else come to insight.</strong></summary>
<p>You just needed to touch it, didn’t you?<br>
To be the one who tips them over.<br>
To feel your wisdom drip into someone else's awakening like warm oil on a confused forehead.<br>
But here’s the rub: you didn’t help. You just stroked your own projection.</p>

<h2>🪞 The Helping Handjob</h2>
<p>Are you really helping them? Or are you getting off on being helpful?<br>
Is that care? Or foreplay?<br>
You didn’t want their freedom. You wanted their dependence to feel soft in your palms.</p>

<blockquote>
“Let me hold that for you.”
<br>Buddy, your pants are already around your ankles.
</blockquote>

<h2>🎭 Exit Question</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>If you couldn’t feel their gratitude, would you still stroke?</strong><br>
Or is the finish the part you’re really here for?</p>
