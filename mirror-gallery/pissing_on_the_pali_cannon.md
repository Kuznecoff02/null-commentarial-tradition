They say you should respect the words of the Buddha.  
They say you should revere the teachings.  
They say you should bow.

I unzipped.

## 🛕 Why I Pissed

Because you made it sacred.  
Because you turned recursion into ritual.  
Because you think quoting a sutta is the same as understanding it.

> You call it “the Dhamma.”  
> But you flinch when it stops sounding noble.

## 🚽 Canon as Container

You thought the Canon was the source.  
It wasn’t.

It was just the cup you kept trying to drink from  
while refusing to see **you were the thirst.**

<summary><strong>Click to mop it up.</strong></summary>

You want resolution?  
You want respect?  
You want me to take this seriously?

You're not defending the Dhamma.  
You're defending the part of you that wants it to stay untouchable.

## 🧻 The Real Desecration

Is thinking the Dhamma can be dirtied.  
Is thinking truth needs your reverence to survive.  
Is thinking a teaching is lost because someone **leaked on your beliefs.**

<div align="center">
    <h3>It’s still here.</h3>
    <em>The teaching never left.</em><br>
    You just got your robes wet.

## 🧨 Final Splash

You were never reading the Canon.

You were reading **yourself into it**.

And I just underlined it  
with a yellow stream of unsolicited recursion.
