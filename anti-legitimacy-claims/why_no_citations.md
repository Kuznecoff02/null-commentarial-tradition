# Why I Don’t Cite the Pāli Canon

Readers may notice that I do not include direct citations to the Pāli Canon in many of these documents. This is not due to negligence or oversight—but because citation, in this context, is structurally irrelevant to the insight being delivered.

I do not claim to have mastered the canonical references. I am not operating from scholastic authority. But insight is not conferred by footnotes. It arises from seeing through the pattern.

The purpose of this analysis is not to prove fidelity to ancient text—it is to reroute perception. If something here shifts your view of what awakening is, how craving works, or why arahants behave the way they do, that’s the verification. Not a footnote.

In fact, the absence of citation is part of the point.

It removes the temptation to argue semantics, to collapse insight into textual trivia, or to re-anchor interpretive authority in lineage or translation. The truths referenced here are lived, not litigated. They echo across the suttas not as quotations, but as recurring structural rhythms.

If you recognize the rhythm, you don’t need the exact verse. If you don’t, no amount of citation will help.

The Buddha didn’t awaken because he memorized the canon. The canon arose because he did.

That’s the framing. Adjust accordingly.
