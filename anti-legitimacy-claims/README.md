# README: Legitimacy Folder

This folder is not an attempt to prove legitimacy. It is not here to perform, to impress, or to justify. Its presence exists solely to support interpretive clarity.

Many readers, encountering high-velocity structural writing, may default to common misunderstandings:
- That the author is trying to appear smart
- That the writing reflects egoic self-stroking
- That rhetorical confidence implies personal performance

These are frame errors. They stem from reading the work through a lens of self-based motivation, which does not apply here.

The materials in this folder are designed to reduce friction. They offer clarifications—not defenses—of the lens through which this writing operates. The aim is not persuasion. The aim is non-confusion.

If these documents help you read more clearly, they have served their purpose. If not, they are simply inert context—available but unnecessary.

This folder is not for the author. It is for the reader, so the work can be seen without noise.
