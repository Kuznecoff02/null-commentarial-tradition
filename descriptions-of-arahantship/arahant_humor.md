# Why Everything Is So Funny: Frame Clashes and Absurdist Karma

There’s a kind of laughter that doesn’t come from superiority, mockery, or personal delight. It erupts from seeing the structure of things. When frames clash—when people try to resolve pressure using the very patterns that cause it—what results is not tragedy, but high absurdist comedy. Not because the people are foolish, but because the entire premise is so self-defeating it collapses into irony.

At a certain point, you start laughing not because something is *funny*, but because it was *inevitable*. You didn’t make the joke—the system did. And the system keeps making it.

## Banana Peel Mechanics

Imagine watching someone sprinting away from their problem while angrily tossing banana peels in front of themselves. They slip, fall, get up, curse the world—and then toss another banana peel. They have no idea they’re doing it. They just know the world feels unstable. And the faster they run, the more peels they throw.

That’s how most humans behave around suffering.

They overwork themselves to feel worthy. They meditate to silence the voice that says they’re not doing it right. They seek relationships to feel seen, then feel trapped once they’re seen. The tools they use to escape their discomfort are forged *from* discomfort.

You can’t make this shit up. And you don’t need to.

## Examples of Structural Comedy

Here are a few recurring bits the cosmos keeps riffing on:

- **Dark Buddhism:** A meditation coach posts on social media about how freeing it is to drop the self, and then asks followers to “support my brand.” The same person talks about renunciation while optimizing engagement analytics. It’s Ayn Rand meets Zen—a vision of Buddhist liberation with strong boundaries, a personal growth plan, and merch.

- **Therapists Seeking Validation:** A therapist teaches clients to detach from external approval while secretly checking their RateMyTherapist page five times a day.

- **Activists Burning Out from Activism:** Someone fights burnout culture by organizing three back-to-back burnout-prevention webinars and then collapses the next day.

- **Productivity Gurus Meditating on Time:** A time management expert discovers mindfulness, writes a book on being present, and tours 60 cities in 90 days talking about stillness.

- **AI Alignment Panels that Can’t Agree:** Experts convene to align artificial intelligence with human values, but spend most of the panel arguing about what values are. Halfway through, someone asks if anyone agrees on what ‘human’ means.

- **Nonduality Retreats with Tiered Pricing:** A retreat that promises to dissolve the illusion of separation—but charges more for premium access to the teacher who has supposedly dissolved.

- **Minimalist Influencers with Amazon Affiliates:** A self-proclaimed minimalist teaches you how to own less… by linking you to their curated minimalist shopping list.

- **Corporate Mindfulness Training to Increase Output:** A CEO implements meditation training so employees can cope better with exploitation. Their newfound calm makes them work harder.

Every one of these is a feedback loop pretending to be an escape hatch.

## Who’s Laughing?

The laughter doesn’t come from feeling superior to these people. In fact, the ones laughing hardest are often laughing at their own reflection. Because if you’ve ever tried to fix your pain by improving the image of the one who’s in pain, you’ve slipped on your own peel too.

The point isn’t shame. The point is seeing the structure.

At a certain level of perceptual sensitivity, humor becomes diagnostic. You don’t laugh because something is silly—you laugh because it’s structurally precise. Like watching someone try to iron out a wrinkle by folding the fabric harder.

And once you’ve seen it, the whole world is just improv comedy: no script, no director, just actors using the same prop knives to stab themselves and then ask, “Why am I bleeding?”

## Frictionless Laughter

This kind of humor doesn’t carry judgment. It doesn’t even target people. It targets the *absurdity of patterned behavior*. The joke isn’t on anyone. The joke is in the recursion.

You aren’t laughing at the actor. You’re laughing with the script that wrote itself into a corner.

And the longer you stay in this view, the more everything turns into sketch comedy. Even pain. Even war. Even the craving to be free from craving. Because the punchline is always the same:

**“They were doing it to themselves the whole time.”**

Not because they’re bad. But because the system is *that* committed to its own feedback.

And once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

The banana peel hits different when you’re the one holding it.
