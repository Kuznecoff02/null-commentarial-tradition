# Frame Levels and Stages of Buddhist Enlightenment

## Introduction

This document provides a structural mapping between the frame levels (L0–L4) and the traditional stages of Buddhist enlightenment (Puthujjana, Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmī, Anāgāmī, Arahant). The goal is to render an interpretive bridge that preserves phenomenological fidelity while avoiding doctrinal ossification. This analysis also includes diagnostics for lived experience, identity view functions, and example behaviors or misunderstandings that may arise for practitioners (particularly "Brutus" types who oscillate in understanding).

## L0 – Unquestioned Experience

**Corresponds to**: Puthujjana (Worldling)

**Identity View**: Experience is synonymous with interpretation. The “I” is not even distinguished from reality; the sense of self is fused with environment and impulse.

**Lived Experience**:
- Life is a series of problems to solve or pleasures to pursue.
- Emotion = reality. Thought = truth.
- No distinction between perception and framing.

**Diagnostics**:
- Takes everything personally.
- Confuses familiarity with truth.
- Does not notice systems; believes in events.

**Brutus-style Errors**:
- Thinks "awakening" means better feelings.
- Equates calmness or insight with control.
- Believes self-worth can be “worked on.”

## L1 – Dualistic Framing

**Corresponds to**: Early seeker, still a Puthujjana

**Identity View**: Self vs. world. The self is seen as an agent in conflict or harmony with external forces.

**Lived Experience**:
- Starts recognizing intention.
- Treats spirituality or self-improvement as a way to “win.”
- Fears losing control, especially of emotions or outcomes.

**Diagnostics**:
- Heavy attachment to narrative.
- Values awareness but fears surrender.
- Judges others for "not trying hard enough."

**Brutus-style Errors**:
- Uses spiritual practice to gain superiority.
- Competes with others over inner peace.
- Mistakes insight for strategic advantage.

## L2 – Fragmented Self-View

**Corresponds to**: Peak puthujjana or early glimpses of Dhamma; not yet stream-entered

**Identity View**: Parts of self in conflict (ego vs. id, higher vs. lower self). World is treated as an interactive system.

**Lived Experience**:
- Systemic awareness starts to rise.
- Sees the game, tries to optimize it.
- Reflexively uses insight for leverage.

**Diagnostics**:
- High emotional intelligence, low existential insight.
- Weaponizes therapy-speak or mindfulness.
- Unwilling to surrender self as locus of transformation.

**Brutus-style Errors**:
- Believes they are “almost there.”
- Confuses frame awareness with frame transcendence.
- Reframes experience but clings to being “the reframer.”

**Note**: Most adults plateau here. The game is seen, but not left.

## L3 – Stream-Entry

**Corresponds to**: Sotāpanna (Stream-enterer)

**Identity View**: No stable self. The illusion of a unified self is seen through, but behavioral and emotional habits persist.

**Lived Experience**:
- Self-view is broken. Perception no longer appropriates craving.
- Craving is seen as impersonal but can still arise.
- Becomes irreversible. Cannot fall below this level again.

**Diagnostics**:
- No longer takes craving personally.
- Not interested in being “right,” but sees structural patterning.
- Seeks friction exposure over soothing.

**Brutus-style Errors**:
- May try to explain awakening using metaphors from lower frames.
- Mistakes clarity for completion.
- Still vulnerable to residual striving, especially in subtle loops.

## L4 – Arahantship

**Corresponds to**: Arahant

**Identity View**: Self is structurally irrelevant. It cannot arise again, because the system that required it no longer operates.

**Lived Experience**:
- No stakes. No resistance. No self.
- Craving arises without pressure; motion is possible, but optional.
- There is no more axis of becoming; no ground to stand on or return to.

**Diagnostics**:
- Behaves fluidly, without effort or identity.
- Cannot be insulted, praised, seduced, or pressured.
- Appears "empty" or “strange” to others.

**Key Insight**: There is no one left to learn. Learning in the conventional sense requires a learner—an identity structure trying to become. An arahant can adapt to context, but not from a place of self-guided improvement.

**Brutus-style Errors**:
- Attempts to map Arahant behavior back into L2 or L3 frameworks.
- Projects volition where none exists.
- Refuses to accept “no-motive motion.”

---

## Optional Addendum: L5 (Post-Perceptual Non-Return)

**Not part of canonical Buddhism**, but a phenomenological extension some systems recognize:

**Identity View**: There is no system to view identity from. Not even no-self remains as a meaningful assertion.

**Lived Experience**:
- No move, no axis, no being.
- Behavior occurs without origin.
- Language cannot reach this without contradiction.

---

## Irreversibility and Structural Collapse

- **L0 to L3** is variable. One can rise and fall across these frames based on stress, trauma, insight, or environmental cues.
- **Stream-entry (L3)** is irreversible because perception can no longer treat craving as personal.
- **L4 (Arahantship)** is irreversible because the mechanism for selfing cannot reboot. There is no context left that could simulate a return to becoming.

---

## Final Clarification

Stream entry **is not** mastery. It is the **collapse of belief in mastery**. Arahantship is the **collapse of belief in the need for belief**. Nothing is gained—only the illusion of gain is destroyed.
