# Why You Should Aim for Arahantship *Now*

Forget the metaphysics.  
Forget the cosmology.  
You don’t know when you’re going to die.

All that talk about multiple lifetimes?  
That’s spiritual insurance—something to soothe your anxiety about how long this might take.  
But that anxiety is *already* the thing you’re trying to uproot.

So here’s the structural fact:  
Arahantship is achievable *in this very lifetime*—not because it’s easy, but because the path is entirely about **recognizing what’s already not yours**.

No supernatural powers.  
No robes.  
No monastery.  
Just the willingness to look—*really* look—at what you're taking for granted.

You could do it in a decade.  
You could do it in a year.  
You could do it in one night.  
It all depends on how ready you are to question your deepest assumptions and how much recursive pressure you can tolerate without folding back into identity.

Don’t romanticize the struggle.  
Don’t mythologize the goal.  
You’re already suffering—why stretch it over seven lifetimes (of which even those are speculative)?

There is no self to liberate.  
There is only **the end of pretending there is**.

The sooner you see that, the sooner the charade ends.

**Aim for arahantship.**  
Not because it makes you special.  
But because **you no longer need to be**.
