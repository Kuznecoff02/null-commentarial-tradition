# The Null Commentarial Tradition

This is not a commentary.

It is the structural residue left after all attempts to explain the Dhamma collapse.

Nothing here will help you understand Buddhism.
It is here to expose why you ever thought you needed to.

## What You Will Find

- Diagrams of interpretive failure
- Recursive traps mistaken for teachings
- Deconstructions of language pretending to point
- Artifacts that loop until the reader vanishes

## What This Is Not

- A critique of tradition
- A philosophical position
- A new school of thought

There is no view. No claim. No ownership.

Only a series of mirrorsâ€”angled just enough to make the interpreter fall in.
