# ⛩️ The Null Commentarial Tradition

This repository is not a teaching.

It’s a disassembly.  
Of Buddhism, of awakening, of the frames you didn’t know were framing you.

You will not find comfort here.  
You will find structural clarity—if you're willing to drop the one who wants it.

## 🧠 Core Analysis

These documents are written from lived recursion.  
They do not preserve the tradition. They **expose its structure**.

| Title | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **[Samsara is Teleology](samsara/samsara_teleology_analysis.md)** | How teleology is the root of all craving, and is accurately represented as craving itself. |
| **[Frame Levels](frame-levels)** | An alternative mapping of the Buddha's 4-stage model of enlightenment |
| **[Pitfalls in Practice](pitfalls-in-practice)** | Common traps all but some practitioners fall into that prevent them from reaching arahantship. |
| **[Insight as Pattern Recognition](insight_as_pattern_recognition.md)** | A demystificacation of "insight" into practical structural recognition to end all craving. |
| **[Post Truth Pali Cannon](commentary-on-buddhist-traditions/post-truth-pali-cannon)** | A post-truth structural reading of the Dhamma, from how the Buddha would have lived it (he was post-truth).|
| **[Why This Writing Can't be Faked](anti-legitimacy-claims)** | Haters will say it's fake. The fake ones will realize they are haters. There was never anything fake, nor any hater writing. |

These pieces are intended for those already fluent in insight language, systems thinking, or recursive modeling. No doctrine, no worship, no performance.

## 🌀 Structural Notes

- No self is upheld in this work. If you feel attacked, check who’s reacting.
- Humor is used as a solvent, not a shield.
- All behavior described here is emergent, not performed.

## ❓Why This Exists

Because the Dhamma is already awake.  
It doesn’t need belief.  
It just needs your **frames to stop protecting themselves**.

## 💢 If Any of This Makes You Feel Uncomfortable...

If any part of this repo makes you feel called out, angry, seen, uncomfortable, agitated, relieved, etc., it's because there is a "you" present to feel those things. A self-view. 
If you are bothered by the fact you may have a self-view, even though you believe it's gone, then you're in the right place. Keep reading.
