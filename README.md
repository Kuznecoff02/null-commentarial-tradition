# The Null Commentarial Tradition

This is not a commentary.

It is the structural residue left after all attempts to explain the Dhamma collapse.

Nothing here will help you understand Buddhism.
It is here to expose why you ever thought you needed to.

## What You Will Find

- Diagrams of interpretive failure
- Recursive traps mistaken for teachings
- Deconstructions of language pretending to point
- Artifacts that loop until the reader vanishes

## What This Is Not

- A critique of tradition
- A philosophical position
- A new school of thought

There is no view. No claim. No ownership.

Only a series of mirrors—angled just enough to make the interpreter fall in.

## Why You Might Trust This Writing

You won't find credentials here. No monastic robes, no academic citations, no special lineage transmission. Why? Because those are proxies for something deeper: **clarity**, **discernment**, and the ability to **puncture illusion**.

If this writing:

- Clarifies something that had previously felt muddy,  
- Names a blind spot you didn’t know you had,  
- Shows you that your logic was looping and you didn’t even see the loop,  
- Makes you laugh at how obvious the trap was once you saw it,  
- Or makes you uncomfortable, in exactly the way that reveals where you’ve been hiding—

—then it has done its job.

This writing isn't here to be believed. It's here to **remove the need to believe**.

If it functions, use it. If it doesn’t, discard it.  
But check carefully before discarding—because the thing that resists it might be the very thing it’s pointing to.

No path will ever be *the* path. But some tools slice cleaner than others.
