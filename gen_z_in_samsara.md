# **📉 Gen Z Already Knows Samsara Is Broken**

Let’s be honest.

Gen Z didn’t need to read the Pāli Canon to realize something was off. Most of us were born into a collapsing climate, skyrocketing housing prices, nihilistic meme culture, and an internet that teaches you more about existential dread than high school ever did. By the time we were teenagers, we already knew: **this game is rigged.**

But here’s the twist:

That disoriented, directionless malaise? The sense that you’re stuck in a loop but there’s nowhere to go? That’s not spiritual failure.

That’s an **accidental insight**.[^1]

## **📦 The Box Is the Path**

Traditional Buddhist culture often frames the path as something you walk. Directionality is implicit: toward awakening, away from defilement. But Gen Z grew up watching every system—economic, political, spiritual—fall flat on its face. We didn’t need to be told that chasing success was samsaric. We saw it implode on its own.

What did we do?

We shrugged. 🫠

We memed. 🧃

We dissociated. 🫥

And in doing so—without knowing it—we started doing what most practitioners only arrive at after decades of renunciation: **we stopped believing in the goal.**[^2]

## **🎯 Meaning Is the First Mistake**

Most Buddhist traditions smuggle in the assumption that meaning is real and must be preserved. Even in trying to “let go,” there’s an idea that _this_ letting go is the one that _matters_. But Gen Z doesn’t buy that anymore.

We already live in a world where:

- College doesn’t guarantee a job. 🎓
- Therapy doesn’t guarantee healing. 🛋️
- Politics doesn’t guarantee progress. 🗳️
- “Doing the right thing” doesn’t guarantee safety. 😶‍🌫️

So we gave up on guarantees. And accidentally… that was insight.[^3]

## **🧢 Directionality Is Copium**

The biggest irony? The Gen Z vibe—“we’re screwed but let’s vibe anyway”—is closer to **nibbāna-adjacent** than most Buddhist striving. Why? Because craving has already started to lose its narrative grip.

There’s no “point.”

There’s no “arrival.”

There’s just steering the loop you’re already in.

Not because you hope it’ll change anything. But because the **pressure to change** is gone.[^4]

That’s the punchline.

---

## **🧠 Who’s Actually Ahead?**
 
Most Buddhist practitioners are still trying to _become_ someone. That’s what “practice” is for them: shaping a future self. Gen Z dropped that storyline years ago. Not because we transcended it, but because **we couldn’t afford it.**

And yet…

That resignation, that “meh whatever” energy, is often structurally **closer to awakening** than the fevered striving of someone trying to purify their mind to become a better person™.

Because at least we’re not pretending the wheel goes somewhere.[^5]

## **Footnotes (Post-Ironic)**

[^1]: What you called apathy was just early-stage disenchantment. No robes required.

[^2]: It’s not that we let go—it’s that nothing stuck in the first place. And that’s the real joke.

[^3]: We didn’t meditate on impermanence. We just watched all our plans collapse in real time.

[^4]: The opposite of craving isn’t contentment. It’s irrelevance.

[^5]: You trained for decades to unlearn teleology. We just couldn’t afford rent.
