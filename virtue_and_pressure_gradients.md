**Virtue Is Not Necessary for Enlightenment**

The common understanding is that virtue (sīla) is a prerequisite for enlightenment. But this is only true if virtue is misunderstood as a *moral* requirement. Enlightenment has nothing to do with behavior conforming to rules. It has everything to do with the collapse of **appropriation**—and virtue, properly understood, is just a diagnostic tool to expose the **pressure gradients** that arise when one still clings to meaning, control, and self-view.

Virtue isn’t the path. Virtue is a **mirror**. If a person breaks a precept and feels inner dissonance, that discomfort is not a sign of failure—it is a pointer. The arising of friction shows that something in the system is still being held. The craving to act, the guilt after acting, the desire to suppress—all of these are **movements**, and all of them are conditioned.

And here’s the critical point: virtue is often described in terms of **not doing something**. This negative framing is not about restraint for its own sake, or to build a better moral agent. It’s about revealing **where pressure arises**. What is pulling you? What is pushing you? The instruction not to act is not about creating purity, but about creating **diagnostic clarity**. The discomfort isn't failure—it's a footprint of unresolved implication.

The mistake is to think that the solution is to always act virtuously. That just reinforces a *better self*. But the real point is to track **why** the pressure is there at all. What axis does the pressure ride on? Is it the need to be seen as good? The fear of being bad? The assumption that restraint leads to purity?

People build identities around virtue by saying, “look at all these things I don’t do.” They believe that this restraint will slowly bring about awakening—as if the fire of craving will burn itself out over time. But the candle doesn’t go out because time passes. The candle goes out when the **fuel** is removed. And the real insight is that the fire never had to be burning in the first place.

The goal is not to become a moral person. The goal is to see that **there is no person** to be moral. And that’s why virtue is only useful insofar as it **reveals attachment**. It creates a terrain in which craving becomes visible. But virtue isn’t special. It's just one of many domains where clinging shows up.

Enlightenment does not require being good. It requires being free from the axis of good and bad altogether.

The swaying doesn’t stop because you clamp down harder. The swaying stops when the system no longer needs to balance.

Virtue is not a prerequisite. It’s a pressure map. Use it to see the shape of your craving. And then let even that go.
