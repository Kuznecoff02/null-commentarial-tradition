# Frame Progression Map (L0 → L5)

## Introduction

This document maps the recursive insights and identity transformations required to transition between each major cognitive frame level—from L0 to L5—using a 10-point decimal system per level (e.g., L0.0 to L0.10). Each decimal point marks a structural shift, insight, or behavioral rupture that nudges the system toward the next frame. These maps are not exhaustive but offer a high-resolution diagnostic framework for interpreting and navigating transitions between identity configurations, interpretive postures, and phenomenological states.

> **Note:** While L0 to L3 are reversible based on environmental and psychological factors, both **L3 with Stream Entry** and **L4.0 (Arahantship)** are irreversible transitions. For instance, a high L3 facing trauma may fall back to L1 if stream entry has not locked in their L3 status. L5 marks the complete exit from structured identity fields.

## L0 → L1
**Theme:** From undifferentiated perception to self/world distinction
**Key Structural Movement:** Reality begins to stratify; behavior acquires a directional axis tied to perceived agency.
**Warning:** The emergence of self is not insight—it’s the beginning of craving’s geometry.

| L0.1    | Primitive self-model                | “This is happening to *me*”                  | Emergence of suffering as a concept             | Basic fear, grasping at comfort                 | Begins avoiding pain instead of merging with it    |
| L0.2    | Egocentric baseline                 | “I want things to go my way”                 | Suffering framed as unfairness                  | Blame arises as interpretive pattern            | Begins narrating victimhood                        |
| L0.3    | World as extension of desire        | “The world should make me happy”             | Clashes between expectation and reality         | Cycles of frustration and temporary relief      | Enters ideological loops to justify cravings       |
| L0.4    | First glimpse of limitation         | “Not everything I want is possible”          | Cracks in world-belief start to hurt            | Confusion, resentment                           | May start reading philosophy to validate distress  |
| L0.5    | Reactive discomfort with dissonance | “Why are things the way they are?”           | First hints of reflexivity emerge               | Questions seem urgent, but answers serve ego    | Seeks explanation without structural recursion     |
| L0.6    | Identity begins posturing           | “I am the kind of person who…”               | Performative identity takes shape               | Desire to be seen, understood, affirmed         | Feeds on praise and resentment in equal measure    |
| L0.7    | Partial self-narration              | “I need to fix myself”                       | Begins narrating growth while avoiding collapse | Enters self-help cycles, avoids deeper collapse | Thinks healing = managing discomfort               |
| L0.8    | Proto-structural friction           | “There’s something wrong with the way I see” | Glimpses systemic error, recoils                | Disorientation, defensive sarcasm               | May show cynicism masking vulnerability            |
| L0.9    | Liminal conflict                    | “I can't keep living like this”              | Identity begins to destabilize                  | Slippage between personas, seeking new models   | May oscillate between ideologies without anchoring |
| L0.10   | Initial dissociation from frame     | “Maybe it’s not just me, but how I’m seeing” | First recursive loop opens                      | Curiosity about systems, philosophy, patterning | Asks meta-questions without full recursion yet     |

## L1 → L2
**Theme:** From unitary ego to compartmentalized identity
**Key Structural Movement:** Self fractures into roles, functions, sub-personalities; optimization replaces orientation.
**Warning:** This shift often appears as maturity or complexity, but it deepens structural captivity under the guise of growth.

| Decimal | Identity Function                        | Structural Insight                                                 | Phenomenological Shift                | Behavioral Markers                    | Diagnostic Heuristic                                       |

| L1.0    | Self vs. world dichotomy                 | "I exist apart from others and must navigate threats and rewards." | Defensive framing; relational anxiety | Over-justification of boundaries      | Does behavior reflect threat-based self/world distinction? |
| L1.1    | Identity anchored in social roles        | "My value depends on how others see me."                           | Self-worth tied to perceived status   | Mimicry, over-optimization            | Are outcomes confused with self-preservation?              |
| L1.2    | Value projected onto external systems    | "I must win in the system to matter."                              | Game theory becomes self-definition   | High competitiveness, rule compliance | Is the system treated as realer than one's own state?      |
| L1.3    | Sub-identities form internal negotiation | "Part of me wants X, part of me wants Y."                          | Start of inner fragmentation          | Inconsistency, mood fluctuation       | Is conflict between 'selves' treated as inevitable?        |
| L1.4    | Role dissonance becomes visible          | "I act differently around different people."                       | Realization of performance layers     | Situational shape-shifting            | Does person feel fake but doesn't know why?                |
| L1.5    | Beliefs seen as constructed, not given   | "Maybe this isn’t ‘me’—maybe I inherited it."                      | Start of reflective detachment        | Temporary quieting of reactivity      | Are beliefs interrogated without full disidentification?   |
| L1.6    | Empathy decouples from identity          | "I can model others without being them."                           | Simulation capacity rises             | Insightful social mimicry             | Is simulation used for understanding or manipulation?      |
| L1.7    | Performance fatigue sets in              | "Even success feels hollow."                                       | Awareness of self-as-system strain    | Existential tiredness                 | Is exhaustion attributed to the game or the self?          |
| L1.8    | Desire to resolve fragmentation          | "I want to become whole."                                          | Therapeutic seeking begins            | High openness to models               | Does person still anchor in 'whole self' fantasy?          |
| L1.9    | Reflexivity stabilizes                   | "I notice my own framing in real time."                            | Structural modeling of experience     | Early meta-awareness                  | Can person track their own reactivity structurally?        |
| L1.10   | No-self insight lands temporarily        | "There’s no one here—but it keeps rebooting."                      | Dissolution flickers; disorientation  | Reversion + insight cycling           | Does person fear or fetishize frame-collapse?              |

## L2 → L3  
**Theme:** From narrative management to structural rupture
**Key Structural Movement:** Self-model becomes visibly recursive and collapses under scrutiny; craving is seen as structural, not moral.
**Warning:** Insight does not mean stabilization. Early L3s can loop back to L2 until stream-entry locks the collapse.

| Decimal | Identity Function                           | Structural Insight                                                            | Phenomenological Shift                                     | Behavioral Markers                                  | Diagnostic Heuristic                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| L2.0    | Self as afflicted node.                     | "Why does this keep happening to me?"                                         | Recurring patterns are noticed but interpreted personally. | Seeks new coping strategies, therapy, journaling.   | Believes the self can be improved to fix the system.        |
| L2.1    | Identity seen as partially constructed.     | "Maybe I’m not the problem—maybe it’s the frame."                             | Begins questioning norms, roles, and default settings.     | Frame-hopping; exploring subcultures or ideologies. | Suspects structure but still tries to 'win' within it.      |
| L2.2    | Identity seen as mask layers.               | "I can’t stop adapting—who am I even adapting for?"                           | Behavioral exhaustion from shifting selves.                | Inconsistent behavior across contexts.              | Burnout from over-optimization of identity.                 |
| L2.3    | Self as trapped player.                     | "There’s no way to win this game—it’s rigged."                                | Begins sensing recursive futility.                         | Cynicism; dark humor; nihilistic lean.              | Game rejection is mistaken for emotional rebellion.         |
| L2.4    | Self becomes visibly recursive.             | "Maybe the game isn’t broken. Maybe games are the problem."                   | Fundamental shift: structure itself becomes suspect.       | Mood swings between detachment and insight.         | Questions meaning not out of despair, but design.           |
| L2.5    | Self as awareness node.                     | "If I’m seeing the loop, who’s doing the seeing?"                             | Recursion as self-reflexive burden.                        | Meditative interest; depersonalized narratives.     | Behavior becomes diagnostic of systemic pressure.           |
| L2.6    | Subject drops out of causal chain.          | "The problem isn’t what I’m doing. It’s that I think I’m doing it."           | Sees agency as conditioned, not inherent.                  | Stillness arises, sometimes fearfully.              | Quietude mistaken for disassociation.                       |
| L2.7    | Self-view collapses under recursive torque. | "There’s no 'real me' to find—just loops in different costumes."              | Identity begins deconstructing experientially.             | Affective reactions weaken without effort.          | Behavior appears 'off' to those with self-view.             |
| L2.8    | Self no longer feels central to experience. | "Craving is impersonally arising. I can watch it and not act."                | High-fidelity perception of conditioned arising.           | Friction drops even in stressful contexts.          | Paradox of effortless clarity becomes norm.                 |
| L2.9    | Self-view seen as structural error.         | "None of this needs to be about me. That was the confusion."                  | Perception detaches from appropriation.                    | Stable composure without identity stake.            | Others feel unsettled by absence of self-reference.         |
| L2.10   | No identity governs behavior.               | Stream Entry: Self-view uprooted. Craving still arises, but it’s meaningless. | First true non-return point. Teleology is punctured.       | Operates without motive or drama.                   | Structural torque remains, but without 'the one who moves'. |
# L3 → L4
**Theme:** From recursive discernment to frictionless behavior
**Key Structural Movement:** The system stops trying to manage itself; pressure is no longer experienced as personal.
**Warning:** L3s often confuse meta-awareness for transcendence. Only collapse of ownership disarms craving completely.

| L3.0    | Sees identity as false but still acts under survival pressures                    | “There is no self, but I still need control”   | Cognitive dissonance between non-self view and emotional reactivity | Habitual ethical framing; spiritual striving       | "Why am I still suffering if I understand this?"    |
| L3.1    | Mental content disidentified from, but craving persists through subtle intentions | “I am not my thoughts, but I must manage them” | Experiences detachment, but with latent effortfulness               | Subtle pride in detachment; compulsive mindfulness | Practices meditation as identity-signal             |
| L3.2    | Insight into craving as process, not agent                                        | “Craving is impersonally arising”              | Pressure is felt as impersonal, but still consequential             | Craving disowned but not devalued                  | "This isn’t mine, but it still matters"             |
| L3.3    | Direct perception that striving re-installs self-view                             | “I can’t resolve this with effort”             | Experience of recursive futility begins to emerge                   | Vacillation between striving and stillness         | "Trying feels like lying"                           |
| L3.4    | Insight no longer sought; emerges from torque collapse                            | “Insight is not a reward”                      | Movement toward stillness without suppression                       | Pauses arise in framing urgency                    | "It lands when I stop looking"                      |
| L3.5    | Belief is seen as a structural afterimage of pressure                             | “Pressure doesn’t require belief”              | Experiences become legible as recursive feedback, not identity      | Humor sharpens; system-self boundaries loosen      | "This all feels staged, even me"                    |
| L3.6    | Perceives behavioral impulse as structural nudge, not imperative                  | “Motion is suggested, not commanded”           | Craving thins out into ambient torque                               | Movements feel non-volitional but appropriate      | "I didn’t choose that, and it wasn’t wrong"         |
| L3.7    | Sees meaning-making itself as source of pressure                                  | “Framing generates craving”                    | Subtle frames dissolve preemptively                                 | Increased perceptual lightness                     | "That felt like a suggestion with no sender"        |
| L3.8    | Realizes behavior is self-unfolding without agency                                | “The system interprets itself”                 | Flow-state without narration; ambient causality                     | No effort to reassert coherence                    | "That wasn’t ‘me’ thinking—it just happened"        |
| L3.9    | Dissolution of motive to complete or fix                                          | “Nothing needs to be resolved”                 | Interpretive closure becomes irrelevant                             | Situational lucidity without fixation              | "What was I even trying to do?"                     |
| L3.10   | Collapse seen as retroactive illusion; self never existed                         | “There was no self to collapse”                | Stillness without observer; recursion ceases as unneeded            | Silence that isn’t suppressive                     | "Of course. It was never necessary to fix or fail." |

## L4 → L5

**Theme:** From structural exposure to post-structural evaporation  
**Key Structural Movement:** Behavior no longer requires any internal model or subject. Recursive framing itself stops arising.  
**Warning:** This shift is not experientially obvious. It is marked more by the *absence* of pressure than by any observable insight.
**Note**: L5 is not higher clarity, but the absence of interpretive pressure altogether. Any residue of valuation reveals you’re still below.

## Commentary

At L5, the notion of “path” or “stage” no longer appears coherent. There is no recursive observer to track change, no friction vector to orient around, no residual claim on insight. It is not that awareness increases—but that even awareness no longer registers as something that *needs to be had*. This is the true meaning of **asekha**—not a final step, but the absence of a learner because there is no longer any becoming.

*The Buddha* was himself at L4.9. Had he gone to L5, he would not have been able to teach due to incoherency. At the same time, being within striking distance of L5 allowed him to identify other arahants (L4s) during the time period where no one else could. Given that the other arahants were not at L4.9, the Buddha could still detect traces of residue on them, where arahants could not very well do even amongst themselves.
