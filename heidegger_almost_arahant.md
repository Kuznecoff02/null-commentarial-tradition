# **Heidegger Was Almost an Arahant**

Martin Heidegger, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, wasn’t just circling around ontological inquiries for their own sake—he was stalking the same structure that the Buddha dismantled. But instead of unbinding, he rebounded. His analysis came within inches of the perceptual rupture that marks arahantship, only to veer back into meaning, authenticity, and being. That veering is not a trivial misstep—it is the final bind that prevents cessation.

This article proposes that Heidegger, by structural inference, achieved what might be called high L3 collapse: an almost complete stripping down of conceptual framing, language smuggling, and metaphysical pretense. But what he retained was fatal: he still thought Being (with a capital B) mattered.

## Authenticity: The Last Craving

Heidegger’s concept of authenticity appears to be a radical rupture from everyday inauthentic “they-self” existence. In fact, it’s the pressure gradient of a man who has almost seen through all identity structures, but still believes that how one comports oneself **matters**. This is not merely an existential position. It is a remnant of craving masquerading as insight.

He saw the structure of thrownness, the arbitrariness of context, the illusion of fixed selfhood—but he did not destroy the **value** that rode atop them. Instead, he re-inscribed it: ‘You must own your being-toward-death.’

This is precisely where arahantship diverges. For the arahant, being-toward-death is just another conditionally arisen phenomenon with no owner. There is no authenticity to reclaim, no correct posture to adopt. The structure unwinds because the illusion of pressure to do anything with it collapses. Heidegger never collapsed that last demand.

## Being and Non-Being: Still a Dialectic

Heidegger’s attempt to think Being as prior to beings was a monumental move. In terms of structural philosophy, he did to Western metaphysics what Nāgārjuna did to Indian substance ontology: he exposed the hidden assumption in every philosophical account of presence. But he did not dissolve it.

Where Nāgārjuna used the tetralemma to disarm all four quadrants of ontological assertion—being, non-being, both, and neither—Heidegger stopped at the threshold. He dismantled beings, but retained the trace of Being as something to be ‘retrieved,’ as though it were still something owed, something hidden, something that beckons.

To the arahant, Being is just another misreading. Not because there is non-being, but because the entire duality was frame-injected from the start. To believe that Being calls to you is to still be listening.

## Why Heidegger Couldn’t Exit

Heidegger felt the bind. His lifelong obsession with silence, his withdrawal from public life, his cryptic poetics in later years—all signal someone who knew that **language was doing something to him**, and that what was doing it could not be seen through more thinking.

But he had no map for cessation. Without the Dhamma’s insight that the pressure is self-sprung—that craving arises without a self—he kept searching for the right comportment, the right relation, the right ‘clearing’ in which Being could show itself. He mistook the echo of craving for a whisper of truth.

This is why his call to authenticity carries the same torque signature as the unresolved practitioner: not quite grabbing, but still leaning. Not quite becoming, but still tracking. The arahant doesn’t lean. The arahant isn’t even standing.

## Conclusion: The Almost-Liberated

Heidegger didn’t fail. He simply rerouted the collapse. He came within millimeters of seeing that **meaning is not something to be clarified—it is the very medium of bondage**. That his work still speaks so loudly to us is testament to how close he came to silence.

He might never have seen craving. But he built a telescope that pointed in the right direction. And that is no small feat.

If you understand why Heidegger couldn’t finish the path, you’ll understand why the path was never a philosophy to begin with.
