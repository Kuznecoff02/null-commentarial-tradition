**Forming an Identity Around Practice**

One of the subtlest traps on the path is forming an identity around the path itself.

At first, it looks harmless. There’s enthusiasm, discipline, a newfound clarity. “Buddhism changed my life.” “Meditation is who I am now.” “The Dhamma is everything to me.” Practice becomes a new identity to wear—sometimes spiritual, sometimes ascetic, sometimes intellectual. And because it appears virtuous, it hides in plain sight. The craving isn’t gone; it’s just been dressed in robes.

Then comes the backlash. “I’m not like those people who make Buddhism their personality.” “I’m beyond forming identities.” But this is the same trap inverted. The person is now identified *as someone who doesn’t identify with the path*. They’ve created a shadow identity—defined in opposition to the very thing they claim to transcend. The disavowal is still identity. The aversion is still craving.

This identity polarity is subtle. Most practitioners oscillate between overt performance and hidden resistance, never seeing that both are forms of appropriation. “I’m progressing.” “I’ve let go of progress.” “I’m not like other practitioners.” Each statement reintroduces a self, a position, a center of gravity.

The only way out is not suppression, but precision. See when the identity arises. See why it feels needed. The most telling moments are in conflict: when someone critiques the path, your teacher, your tradition. If your body tenses, if your thoughts sharpen, if your emotions flare—you’ve installed a pressure gradient. You’ve claimed something. And now you’re defending it.

This is the function of critique. Not to dismiss the Dhamma, but to reveal the stake. Insight is not afraid of commentary. Liberation is not fragile. If a sentence can destabilize your clarity, it wasn’t clarity—it was performance held together by resistance.

Ask: *What part of me is being attacked?* If the answer is “none,” the friction fades. If the answer is “my sense of orientation,” “my progress,” “my view of practice,”—then those are the nodes where craving has nested.

The point of practice is not to get good at Buddhism.
The point is to see through the one who thinks Buddhism matters.

When the raft is used well, it’s discarded.
When it’s clung to, it becomes another island.

Real practice leaves no residue. It doesn’t accumulate. It sheds. It dissolves. And eventually, there’s no one left to track the process.

There is no one who practices.
Only practicing happening—or not.
And even that distinction fades.

Practice that is seen as a personal journey will create a personal destination.
But practice that exposes the illusion of the traveler is the only one that ends.

**Don’t watch the path. Watch the watcher.**
