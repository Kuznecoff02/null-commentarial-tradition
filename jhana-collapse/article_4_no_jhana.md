# **Article 4: You Don’t Need Jhāna for L4**

One of the most persistent misunderstandings in modern Theravāda, particularly in traditions like Hillside Hermitage, is the belief that **jhāna is not only necessary for anagāmi**, but for L4 itself. This belief is usually not stated outright but is embedded in the implied causal chain: practice virtue → develop jhāna → sustain it → see things clearly enough → collapse craving. While compelling on the surface, this model contains a structural confusion.


## The Structural Truth

L4 is not reached by polishing states. It is reached by **collapsing the premise** that there is a state to reach. 

Jhāna may attenuate pressure, slow the system, and even reveal craving’s outlines more clearly—but it is **not itself insight**. You can be in fourth jhāna and still operate from identity. You can see space collapse in the eighth and still reinforce subtle views of ownership, subtle aims of attainment.

Jhāna may _support_ insight, but it never _causes_ it. Why? Because craving collapse is not a matter of nervous system tone. It is a structural realization: **there is no point to this movement**. That realization can dawn in jhāna—but also outside it. It does not depend on silence or stillness. It depends on seeing that **any structure meant to reach stillness is already missing the point**.

## **Where Hillside Gets It Wrong: Jhāna as a Path vs. Frame Collapse**

One of the clearest examples of frame reification can be seen in Hillside Hermitage’s treatment of jhāna. In their article [“What the Jhānas Actually Are,”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/what-the-jhanas-actually-are/) they assert:

> “You can’t develop the higher stages of mind (i.e. jhānas and samādhi) _without_ restraining yourself. _Restraint is the first jhāna._”

This framing collapses jhāna into an _achievement_, a milestone acquired through behavioral restraint. The implication is unmistakable: **if you haven’t climbed the ladder of behavioral modification, you haven’t entered jhāna.** They continue:

> “Jhāna _is not optional_. You can’t become an anāgāmī (a non-returner) without it.”

This is the core error. Framed this way, jhāna becomes a **precondition** to awakening, rather than the **residue** of structural disengagement. In their logic, restraint leads to clarity, clarity leads to jhāna, and sustained jhāna eventually leads to awakening. It’s a stepwise algorithm—a teleological pipeline. But this entire scaffolding presupposes that the _absence of pressure_ must be **produced**, rather than **revealed**.

In another piece, [“Sīla is Samādhi,”](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sila-is-Samadhi.pdf) they double down:

> “If the mind becomes incapable of acting out against the precepts, that’s the second jhāna already.”

Virtue here is equated with structural incapacity to violate norms—which **assumes jhāna is just prolonged moral frictionlessness**. But this reifies virtue into behavioral rigidity, and then claims that this rigidity _produces_ the structural insights of awakening. It’s behavioral modeling mistaken for insight.

But here’s the structural collapse they miss:

> **Anāgāmi isn’t reached through jhāna—it’s revealed when teleological pressure collapses.**

In other words, **frame rupture** produces behavior that resembles restraint—but restraint is not the cause. They invert causality.

Yes, many arahants _appear_ virtuous. Yes, they sit still. Yes, they may dwell in jhāna effortlessly. But this is not because they’ve “mastered the steps.” It’s because there is no longer a self resisting. The friction is gone. Not suppressed—gone.

A meditator can spend decades cultivating virtue and hitting jhāna states—yet never collapse craving. Why? Because **you can enter jhāna while still believing in the game.** You can master suppression without dismantling identification. And so, craving persists—_in subtler and subtler forms_, mistaking order for freedom.

This is why Hillside’s logic can produce stream-enterers who never reach L4. They succeed in behavioral modification, but never **see through the axis of teleology itself**. Their ladder never collapses—so they never stop climbing.


### **From Behavioral Ladder to Existential Leverage**

The insight is simple:

> **Jhāna does not cause awakening. Awakening causes ambient jhāna.**

When craving collapses, the nervous system calms. The breath settles. The stick dissolves. The carrot loses significance. You don’t need a posture, you don’t need a practice—you’ve exited the game entirely.

Yes, meditative jhāna _can_ help loosen craving’s grip. It can temporarily deflate the illusion of pursuit. But if the structure remains teleological—if there’s still a **“next step”**—then the insight hasn’t landed. The stick and carrot still govern behavior, just with new vocabulary.

## Jhāna as Scenic Detour

This is why stream-enterers can cultivate deep jhānas and never reach L4. Their craving has partially collapsed—perhaps in relation to self-view or metaphysical beliefs—but **the frame infrastructure remains**. They meditate, they feel good, they observe clarity, but they **do not question the one who is doing it**. They treat jhāna as a tool to upgrade their mind, not as a mirror revealing the one who is trying to upgrade.

You can persist in jhāna for decades. You can refine it, master it, teach it. None of that guarantees L4. 

Why? Because jhāna **is not built to dissolve views**—only craving. And craving can return the moment jhāna ends, unless the **logic of craving** is seen through.

## The Real Work

The real work of reaching L4 is **seeing that the system you are in is unresolvable**. That every move to purify, perfect, or transcend still exists within a teleological loop. This can happen in jhāna—but also while walking, thinking, conversing, or reading. It happened for some while sweeping a path. It happened for others in crisis.

What matters is not the state. What matters is whether the **structure holding the craving loop** has been punctured.

If jhāna helps you loosen the knot, fine. But you don’t have to uncoil every loop of tension. You only have to realize the rope was never tied.

## The Collapse Doesn’t Need a Cushion

L4 can arrive while lying in bed, eating breakfast, or watching your thoughts fail to hook you. It does not require stillness. It does not require silence. It requires only one thing: **non-participation in the engine**. When that engine is seen to be self-justifying, self-sustaining, and absurd, it dies.

And jhāna? It might still be there. But it will not matter. Because the one who was trying to get to jhāna is no longer needed.

This is the real irony: jhāna can accompany L4. But it is not the cause. 

You don’t climb into L4 through jhāna. You fall out of teleology. And when you land, you find that jhāna was already ambient.

There is no prerequisite. There is no ladder. There is only this: the recognition that **every state is irrelevant once the craving to reach it is gone**.
