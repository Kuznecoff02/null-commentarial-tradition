# **Article 4: You Don’t Need Jhāna for L4**

One of the most persistent misunderstandings in modern Theravāda, particularly in traditions like Hillside Hermitage, is the belief that **jhāna is not only necessary for anagāmi**, but for L4 itself. This belief is usually not stated outright but is embedded in the implied causal chain: practice virtue → develop jhāna → sustain it → see things clearly enough → collapse craving. While compelling on the surface, this model contains a structural confusion.

## Hillside's Implied Model

At Hillside, the framing tends to go something like this: If you sit in jhāna long enough, the mind begins to see its own absurdity. Pleasure is high, craving is low, and in that low-craving environment, insight has a chance to land. In this way, jhāna is framed as the _prerequisite condition_ for irreversible insight. 

The problem with this view is subtle but foundational: it smuggles in **teleology** under the guise of purification. Jhāna is no longer just a tranquil state; it becomes a **progress bar**, a spiritual gradient you must fill up before insight becomes possible. But this collapses the structural distinction between **phenomenological refinement** and **frame disintegration**. The former alters the _content_ of consciousness; the latter dissolves the _container_.

## The Structural Truth

L4 is not reached by polishing states. It is reached by **collapsing the premise** that there is a state to reach. 

Jhāna may attenuate pressure, slow the system, and even reveal craving’s outlines more clearly—but it is **not itself insight**. You can be in fourth jhāna and still operate from identity. You can see space collapse in the eighth and still reinforce subtle views of ownership, subtle aims of attainment.

Jhāna may _support_ insight, but it never _causes_ it. Why? Because craving collapse is not a matter of nervous system tone. It is a structural realization: **there is no point to this movement**. That realization can dawn in jhāna—but also outside it. It does not depend on silence or stillness. It depends on seeing that **any structure meant to reach stillness is already missing the point**.

## Jhāna as Scenic Detour

This is why stream-enterers can cultivate deep jhānas and never reach L4. Their craving has partially collapsed—perhaps in relation to self-view or metaphysical beliefs—but **the frame infrastructure remains**. They meditate, they feel good, they observe clarity, but they **do not question the one who is doing it**. They treat jhāna as a tool to upgrade their mind, not as a mirror revealing the one who is trying to upgrade.

You can persist in jhāna for decades. You can refine it, master it, teach it. None of that guarantees L4. 

Why? Because jhāna **is not built to dissolve views**—only craving. And craving can return the moment jhāna ends, unless the **logic of craving** is seen through.

## The Real Work

The real work of reaching L4 is **seeing that the system you are in is unresolvable**. That every move to purify, perfect, or transcend still exists within a teleological loop. This can happen in jhāna—but also while walking, thinking, conversing, or reading. It happened for some while sweeping a path. It happened for others in crisis.

What matters is not the state. What matters is whether the **structure holding the craving loop** has been punctured.

If jhāna helps you loosen the knot, fine. But you don’t have to uncoil every loop of tension. You only have to realize the rope was never tied.

## The Collapse Doesn’t Need a Cushion

L4 can arrive while lying in bed, eating breakfast, or watching your thoughts fail to hook you. It does not require stillness. It does not require silence. It requires only one thing: **non-participation in the engine**. When that engine is seen to be self-justifying, self-sustaining, and absurd, it dies.

And jhāna? It might still be there. But it will not matter. Because the one who was trying to get to jhāna is no longer needed.

This is the real irony: jhāna can accompany L4. But it is not the cause. 

You don’t climb into L4 through jhāna. You fall out of teleology. And when you land, you find that jhāna was already ambient.

There is no prerequisite. There is no ladder. There is only this: the recognition that **every state is irrelevant once the craving to reach it is gone**.
