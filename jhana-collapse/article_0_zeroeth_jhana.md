# **Article 0: The Zeroeth Jhāna: Life Inside Craving**

Most people don’t realize they’re meditating all the time.

Not formally, of course. But structurally, they are deeply absorbed in a kind of ongoing, involuntary trance. It is not jhāna in the classical sense, but it *is* absorption—into craving, identity, narrative, and directional pressure. This is what we call the **zeroeth jhāna**: the default human state, where awareness is perpetually absorbed into the simulation of lack.

## The Structure of Zeroeth Jhāna

Zeroeth jhāna is not stillness. It is the continuous *failure to be still*. It is not peace. It is the attempt to resolve a problem that doesn’t exist. It is the lived rhythm of **teleological hallucination**: the sense that something needs to happen next, that you are on your way somewhere, that your current state is insufficient.

And it is invisible because it is *normalized*. This is how people wake up. This is how they eat. This is how they speak to their loved ones. Every motion carries a subtle implication: *I must be understood, I must be better, I must avoid collapse, I must pursue validation*. The nervous system is never off-duty. The default is **seeking**.

## How This Looks in Daily Life

- Scrolling social media looking for novelty or confirmation
- Having a conversation while internally managing self-image
- Planning out the next step, even during a moment of apparent rest
- Eating not to eat, but to quell restlessness or emotional gaps
- Maintaining relationships not for connection, but for reassurance
- Reading a spiritual text and interpreting it as a list of "how to get better"

None of this is wrong. It’s just unconscious. It’s the world *before* the first jhāna, where the entire perceptual apparatus is tilted toward doing, becoming, avoiding, securing. The mind *does not know how to be at rest* because the architecture of craving has never been questioned.

## Why This Matters

This article series isn’t for people who want to "add jhāna" to their toolkit. It’s for people who are ready to **see that they’ve never left the zeroeth jhāna**. That what they call normal life is actually a form of deep, compulsive absorption—just into a field of unresolved implication instead of a breath object or body scan.

Realizing this doesn’t require special states. It requires noticing that your nervous system is always bracing for something. That even your rest has a motive. That your peace is contingent on conditions being just right. That your attention is constantly preoccupied with what must be handled, improved, maintained, avoided.

## Structural Markers of Zeroeth Jhāna

- Persistent sense of lack, even when conditions are good
- Inability to sit still without needing a purpose
- Pressure to be productive, seen, or correct
- Emotional spikes based on perceived control or loss
- Seeking frameworks, teachings, or labels to stabilize identity, sense of direction, state of becoming

This is not a critique. It is a mirror. If you’re in the zeroeth jhāna, it doesn’t mean you’re lost. It means you’re *normal*. But once seen, this state becomes the **launch point** for all the rest.

Jhāna isn't where you go. It's what becomes visible when the zeroeth one stops running in the background.
