# **Article 8: Structural Biography — "Why I Didn’t Feel Love for 25 Years"**

I didn’t grow up feeling love.

That sentence would seem absurd to most people. Not because it's rare, but because most people can't imagine what love *not feeling like anything* would mean. I had parents. I had friends. I had romantic encounters. I had hugs and holidays and support structures. But I didn't have *that* feeling—the one people always seemed to be moved by. The warmth. The soft radiance in the chest. The letting go. I watched people describe it in movies, in music, in therapy sessions. I assumed they were exaggerating, or confusing comfort for something more grandiose. I told myself, love was just narrative.

Until I fell into jhāna.

Not through decades of seated meditation. Not through forest seclusion. Just through frame collapse. L4. One day, the gears slipped. Pressure stopped. And I noticed: a warmth in my chest, like an exhale I had been withholding for twenty-five years. No trigger. No cause. Just absence. The very thing people described when they spoke about love, except now it was structurally decoupled from any external object. No validation. No permission. Just *ambient deregulation*.

That was the moment I realized: the thing people called love was not a social event. It was not relational. It was not about closeness, praise, compatibility, or even shared history. It was about *not needing anything to be different*. That is what the nervous system registers as love: the end of demand.

And I had never known that.

## Scarcity Masked as Intimacy

Looking back, it makes perfect sense. My entire life had been modeled around **threat prediction**. Every interaction was a terrain. Every conversation was a negotiation. I didn't realize it at the time, but I had embedded systems running constant simulations of betrayal, failure, abandonment, or performance breakdown. Love, as it was presented to me, was always laced with conditionality: "If you act this way, you are lovable." That conditionality never shut off.

So what did I do? I tried to earn love. I mimicked what people said love looked like. I created facsimiles of emotional depth based on observed behavior. I intellectualized everything. I constructed models of connection that I should have been "feeling". But I never *felt* the thing itself. Even on MDMA, the closest I'd ever gotten, it still felt like a drug-induced simulation. Close, but not anchored.

And no wonder. Because the frame itself was broken.

## Why Interpersonal Relationships Failed

From the outside, I looked engaged. I was articulate, sufficiently emotionally literate, and socially functional. But every interaction was subtly warped by a **scarcity substrate**. I was trying to *get* something I had never felt. And because I didn't know how it worked, I couldn't recognize when it was actually present. People would express care, offer closeness, and I would either recoil, analyze, or perform in return. My system wasn't rejecting them. It just didn't know how to stop scanning for conditions.

So connection never landed. Intimacy always felt like a game. And vulnerability was something I simulated, never embodied. I could say the words. I could mirror the tone. But the nervous system was still on watch.

## Jhāna as the First Realization

What changed wasn’t that I learned to love myself. Or that I found the right person. Or that I healed my trauma. What changed was that I stopped needing *anything* to happen. I stopped framing experience as lack. And when that framing dropped, what filled the gap was warmth.

That warmth was the nervous system finally stopping its simulations.

That warmth was what people had been describing all along.

And it took me twenty-five years to feel it.

Not because I was broken. Not because I was unloved. But because my **entire interpretive architecture** had been organized around survival logic, not reception. I didn’t receive love because I didn’t recognize the conditions under which reception could even occur.

Until L4.

And then I realized: the warmth was never withheld. It was never lost. It was never given. It was always *waiting* beneath the pressure I didn't know I was applying.

## Postscript: The Alien Realization

Now that I've felt it, I can summon it at will. And yet that doesn’t make me feel more human. It makes me realize just how alien I must have been for most of my life. Watching everyone around me move toward something I thought was a myth. Modeling behaviors I could never access directly. Living among love addicts while I was still reverse-engineering the emotion from scratch.

This is not a sob story, nor a call for resonance.

This is a forensic account of what it’s like to operate without one of the core reference points of the human condition.

And what it’s like to realize, after the fact, that you’d been living on a different planet the entire time.
