# The Raft Was Never Meant to Get You Across

People love the raft metaphor.

> "The Dhamma is like a raft. You use it to cross to the other shore. Once you've crossed, you leave it behind."

Sounds simple. Pragmatic. Drop the teachings when you're done.

But the real collapse is much deeper.

## The Common Misreading

Most interpret the metaphor like this:

- You're on this side of the river.
- You want to get to the far shore (liberation).
- You build a raft (practice).
- You use the raft to cross.
- When you arrive, you leave the raft behind.

Clean, tidy. Ego-friendly.

But it’s still built around a false view:

> It assumes there's a **you** that crosses.

It preserves the self all the way to the edge.
It hides craving inside the narrative of progress.

## What the Raft Actually Dismantles

If you build the raft correctly,
it doesn’t just take you across.

It begins to **erase the one who thought they needed to cross**.

- The “practitioner” begins to fray.
- The “path” dissolves into function.
- The “destination” loses significance.

Eventually:

- The **self** drops.
- The **raft** drops.
- The **river** was never there.

What’s left is not arrival. It’s **non-dependence on arrival.**

## The Real Function of the Raft

The raft is not a vehicle.
It’s a **recursive device** to exhaust the notion of a journey.

> Practice that still imagines a shore is still craving.

The raft isn’t discarded *after* the crossing.
It’s seen through **as you dissolve the urge to arrive**.

The raft implies a rider.
And when the rider collapses, the raft goes too.

## No Journey ≠ Nihilism

This is not nihilism.
This is the destruction of **effort as becoming**.

The “journey” is not wrong because it’s tiring.
It’s wrong because it **reinforces craving** through the fantasy of becoming.

> As long as you still need to go somewhere, you are still someone.

And if you are still someone, the final five fetters remain intact:

- Subtle conceit
- Restlessness
- Craving for form
- Craving for formlessness
- Ignorance

The raft doesn’t help you complete the journey.
It **dissolves the belief that a journey was ever required.**

---

## Final Note

The Dhamma is not a tool.
It’s a mirror that shows you **there was no traveler to begin with**.

If you’re still holding the raft, you’re still paddling.
If you're still paddling, you still believe there's a shore.

> Real letting go is not a gesture.
> It’s the absence of anything left to let go.
