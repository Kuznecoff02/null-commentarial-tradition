# Subtle Aims and Unspoken Anchors: Rereading “Skill in Questions”

Ajahn Geoff’s *Skill in Questions* is widely respected for its clear presentation of the Buddha’s strategic approach to dialogue. It emphasizes the functional elegance of right view and the Buddha’s ability to adapt his response to fit the needs of the listener. However, embedded within this otherwise skillful framing are quiet traces of teleological bias—assumptions about goals, motives, and aims that subtly reintroduce self-view into a teaching meant to dismantle it.

This isn’t a critique of Ajahn Geoff’s integrity or clarity, but a gentle pointing toward the latent structures behind language—structures that, when left unexamined, imply intentionality, identity, and direction where none are needed. What follows is a structural re-reading of five key moments in the text, illustrating how teleology is smuggled in and how it could be gently excised.

## 1. Implying the Buddha was ‘aiming’ to lead others to awakening

> **Original (p. 16):**  
> “The Buddha’s goal in teaching was to bring about true release, so his questions were aimed at leading his listeners to see where they were causing themselves suffering and how they could stop.”

**Teleological Slip:**  
This framing inserts a directional motive (“goal”), a self-contained strategy (“aimed at”), and a sense of progress (“leading his listeners”). These choices reinforce a subtle model of the Buddha as an agent navigating others toward an end-state.

**Reframed Non-Teleological Version:**  
"The Buddha’s responses exposed the operations that sustained stress. When questioned, his replies revealed where clinging persisted—not as a tactic, but as a function of attuned discernment."

**Why This Matters:**  
Describing teaching as “aimed at” a goal presupposes a subject with purpose. But a Buddha does not teach *to* accomplish something. The behavior expresses conditions, not intention.

## 2. Framing insight as something that needs to be 'encouraged' or 'drawn out'

> **Original (p. 18):**  
> “...when the listener was already close to awakening, the Buddha would simply pose a question to draw out the remaining insight.”

**Teleological Slip:**  
“Draw out” implies there’s a fixed kernel inside that must be extracted—a latent insight that the Buddha helps bring to light. This again centers the Buddha as a strategic agent and implies the listener as containing a developmental path waiting to unfold.

**Reframed Non-Teleological Version:**  
"In certain cases, a well-placed question would coincide with a shift in the listener’s perception, revealing what had already begun to unravel."

**Why This Matters:**  
Awakening isn’t latent content waiting to be realized. It’s a collapse of the illusion that anything was missing. “Drawing out” maintains the idea of hidden progress.

## 3. Depicting questions as ‘tools’ for realization

> **Original (p. 21):**  
> “For the Buddha, questions were tools—means of engineering a realization.”

**Teleological Slip:**  
This is perhaps the clearest teleology: the metaphor of tools used to achieve a result. It implies construction, outcome, and linear process.

**Reframed Non-Teleological Version:**  
"The Buddha’s questions operated as structural exposures. Their function lay in interrupting assumed coherence, not in producing realization."

**Why This Matters:**  
A question that causes collapse doesn’t “engineer” awakening. It reveals friction in the listener’s own architecture—awakening is not built, but unbound.

## 4. Attributing benevolent foresight to the Buddha’s strategy

> **Original (p. 24):**  
> “He would often ask questions not just to guide a conversation, but to plant seeds that would bear fruit much later.”

**Teleological Slip:**  
The Buddha is depicted as acting with strategic benevolence across time—“planting seeds” implies that he operated with long-term causal foresight, reinforcing a view of a centralized agent with purpose.

**Reframed Non-Teleological Version:**  
"Some questions produced no visible shift, yet later, the memory of them arose under different conditions—revealing their disruptive resonance."

**Why This Matters:**  
Causality in the Dhamma is not manipulation over time. The echo of a past question isn’t the result of benevolent intent, but the conditioned unfolding of a system no longer shielded by narrative.

---

## 5. Describing the Dhamma as a path 'designed' for a goal

> **Original (p. 30):**  
> “The Dhamma was a carefully designed system, constructed to lead beings from suffering to freedom.”

**Teleological Slip:**  
This implies the Dhamma is a kind of spiritual technology—designed, constructed, with clear input-output logic and a directional payload (from suffering to freedom).

**Reframed Non-Teleological Version:**  
"The Dhamma articulates the structural relationships through which suffering arises and ceases. It does not lead beings—it describes the mechanics of entanglement and release."

**Why This Matters:**  
The Dhamma isn’t a product made for an audience. It’s the articulation of how pressure propagates and vanishes. Describing it as “constructed” implies authorship and thus self-view.

## Final Reflections

These reframings are not semantic quibbles. They are a reminder that even in the most precise Dhamma expositions, language can carry shadows of self-view. Words like “aim,” “tool,” “designed,” and “lead” are not neutral—they project teleology into a system whose entire thrust is to deconstruct it.

To see this is not to attack the author. It is to see the residue of intention—traced gently—and ask what’s left when even that is let go.

Because the Buddha did not teach *to awaken people*.

The Buddha taught because there was no one left to stop him.
