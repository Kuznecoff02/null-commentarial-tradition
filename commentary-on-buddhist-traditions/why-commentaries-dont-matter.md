# Why the Commentaries Don’t Matter (And Never Did)

> “There is no need to elaborate what was never yours to begin with.”

## The Problem of Proliferation

The commentarial tradition surrounding the Dhamma—Abhidhamma, Visuddhimagga, and post-canonical elaborations—represents a recursive amplification of description, not discernment. What began as direct structural insight into suffering and its cessation metastasized into taxonomy, enumeration, and scholastic recursion. The goal became clarity *about* the path, rather than collapse *into* it.

This is the central failure of commentary: **it treats recursion as something to be catalogued, not exited**.

## Why More Words ≠ More Insight

Words can point. But when commentary becomes about precision without function, it confuses **semantic layering** for **phenomenological liberation**. Let’s be clear:

- **Suffering doesn’t care what term you use.**
- **Dependent origination doesn’t get clearer through charts.**
- **Liberation is not a theory.**

To build more elaborate descriptions of insight is to reinforce the assumption that *understanding* is upstream of *release*. But in reality, insight **renders understanding meaningless**. When craving ceases, there is no one left to ask *why*.

## The Recursive Explosion That Misses the Exit

The function of dependent origination is recursive—not linear, not taxonomic. It eats itself. That is its brilliance. Every pointer collapses when seen clearly. Yet commentary preserves these pointers as if they were stable objects, worthy of academic admiration or doctrinal loyalty.

But the system was always designed to **dissolve itself**.

- The more you know, the more you interpret.
- The more you interpret, the more you crave clarity.
- The more you crave clarity, the more you miss the axis of craving itself.

So you loop. And the commentaries are **fuel for that loop**.

## No One Crossed the Shore by Naming the Raft

Let’s say this clearly:  
**You don’t get free by studying what freedom might be.**  
You get free by noticing the exact point at which you started to *want* something, and why that impulse felt natural.

That’s the Dhamma.

The rest is ornament.

## Why This Is Not Anti-Intellectualism

This is not an argument against thinking.  
It’s an argument against **thinking as identity**.  
Commentary-as-performance is a subtle form of becoming:  
> “If I master these systems, I will be closer to the truth.”

But insight is *not* progressive. It is recursive rupture. And the more you build structures to stabilize your understanding, the more you reinforce the view that **there is something to understand**.

There isn’t.  
There is only **seeing through**.

## What’s Left, Then?

The Buddha’s original teaching was enough:

> *“This is stress. This is the origin of stress. This is the cessation of stress. This is the path leading to the cessation of stress.”*

Everything else is commentary.  
Everything else is delay.
