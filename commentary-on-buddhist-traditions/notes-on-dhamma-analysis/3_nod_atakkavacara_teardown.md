# Nanavīra Teardown Series: Atakkāvacara

## 1. Introduction

The short note on **Atakkāvacara** (Pāli: “not accessible by reasoning” or “beyond doubt”) explores the limits of rational inquiry versus direct insight. Nanavīra contrasts the Cartesian cogito with the Buddha’s transcendence of doubt, emphasizing that the Dhamma lies outside the domain of discursive thought. While the note reveals sophisticated structural critique, it also retains an authority-based framing and subject-centered scaffolding. This analysis dissects these dimensions, offering deteleologized perspectives.

## 2. Citation & Structural Diagnosis

### Original:
> “Sometimes translated as ‘unattainable by reasoning’ or ‘not accessible to doubt’. But the Cartesian cogito ergo sum is also, in a sense, inaccessible to doubt; for I cannot doubt my existence without tacitly assuming it. This merely shows, however, that one cannot get beyond the cogito by doubting it. And the Dhamma is beyond the cogito. The cogito, then, can be reached by doubt—one doubts and doubts until one finds what one cannot doubt, namely the cogito. But the Dhamma cannot be reached in this way. Thus the Dhamma, though certainly inaccessible to doubt, is more than that; it is altogether beyond the sphere of doubt.”

#### 📌 Analysis:
Nanavīra offers a sharp critique of the sufficiency of reason. His comparison to Descartes demonstrates that even self-assured philosophical certainties cannot penetrate deeper realization. However, this instantiates a subject–object relationship:

- The rational mind (*I*) is making distinctions.
- The Dhamma is an *object* that cannot be reached via this particular subject.
- Authority is invoked through philosophical and canonical credentials.

This is still a **structure of knowing**: a knowing subject encountering an unknowable object.

### 🌀 Deteleologized Rewrite:
> Reason cannot grasp the stillness that precedes discursive cognition. There is no “I” seeking and no “it” found—only the silent pause before thought arises.

## 3. Structural Limitation: Remaining Subject-Centricity

Though Nanavīra dismantles the reliability of reason, he reifies a subtle hierarchy:

- The cogito is first, then the Dhamma is said to be “beyond cogito.”
- This implies a ladder of knowing, one rung higher.

By positioning Dhamma as metaphysically superior to rational certainty, the note sustains an epistemic ascent—implicitly, a subject reaching.

## 4. Citation: Rationalism’s Overreach

### Original:
> “The rationalist, however, does not even reach the inadequate cogito, or if he does reach it, he overshoots the mark (atidhāvati)… for he starts from the axiom that everything can be doubted… Precisely—and what, ultimately, is this Absolute but avijjā… And what, therefore, does the Buddha teach but that this Absolute is not absolute, that it can be brought to an end?”

#### 📌 Analysis:
Nanavīra asserts that both rationalism and metaphysical absolutism eventually fail. He highlights the Buddha’s corrective stance—there is no unassailable absolute. Yet, this is framed as the Buddha *teaching* something *against* a misperception. The cognitive model remains one of subject-led correction.

### 🌀 Deteleologized Rewrite:
> There is no Absolute—only the quiet collapse of structure. The end of absolutism is not an act of correction—but the disappearance of the corrector entirely.

## 5. Structural Summary

| Structural Feature    | Nanavīra’s Framing                                 | Post‑Teleological Collapse                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject–object model  | *I* cannot reach Dhamma                           | No separate knower-it distinction exists                  |
| Ladder of knowing     | Reason → Cogito → Dhamma                          | No ascent; there is only stillness beyond thought         |
| Teaching authority    | Buddha’s teaching as corrective                   | No teaching—only direct noticing beyond systems           |

## 6. Conclusion

Nanavīra’s insight into the limits of reason and absolutism reflects high-level critique. Nevertheless, the structure persists: injustice is recognized and corrected by authoritative intervention. The remaining **subject–authority–object loop** is what prevents structural collapse. Once that loop dissolves, only the silent immediacy is left.

### 🔍 Final Diagnostic:
> *Atakkāvacara shows clarity about the failure of reason—but still ends with a subject speaking about silence. The next phase is to dissolve the speaker altogether, not just elevate the object.*
