# Nanavīra Teardown Series: Kamma

## 1. Introduction

Within his short note on **Kamma**, Ñāṇavīra cites the Suttanipāta verses 651–653 to clarify that identity is formed by present action, not by delayed metaphysical return. He emphasizes ethical agency—‘unskilful vs skilful action’—as the main axis and suggests that the arahant transcends ethics entirely. While the textual analysis is precise, its foundation remains entangled in teleology: ethical value, forward momentum, and structural goals.

## 2. Sutta Quotation & Context

> 651–653 (Suttanipāta):
>
> 653 Evam etam yathābhūtam **kammam** passanti panditā  
> paticcasamuppādadasā **kammavipākakovidā**.  
> *“In this way the wise see action as it really is,  
> seeing dependent arising, understanding result of action.”*

Ñāṇavīra reads vipāka as social consequence, not karmic retribution—restoring verse 653 to its immediate context and rebuking cosmological misreadings.

## 3. Structural Diagnostics

He tracks societal identify based on action: farmer, king, thief. Ethical emphasis:

> “Unskilful action… leads to arising of action, not to cessation of action.  
> Skilful action… leads to cessation of action.”

Yet this scaffolds a **causal ladder**: moral action leads to *a better exit*—a hidden valuation of exit. For him:

> “To the extent that there is still intention… the question ‘What should I do?’ no more arises.”

Still, the **ethical exit** is preserved:

> “Extinction, nibbāna, is cessation of ethics.”

The framing here still *represents* cessation as a goal—an endpoint of ethical development, rather than a structural evaporation of the goal structure. Teleology remains camouflaged.

## 4. Deteleologized Rewrite

> Identity, including ‘ethical’ or ‘unethical’, is just the echo of patterned emergence.  
> Action continues, but no hands push it into categories.  
> Cessation isn’t reached—it isn’t needed. The structural machinery that asked *why* vanished.

## 5. Critique

| Residue Point              | Structural Slip                                               | Collapse Intervention                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ethical valuation          | “Skilful vs unskilful” axis remains active                    | Truth: all action is pattern–dependent emergence. No axis. |
| Exit as objective          | Framed aim as ‘cessation’ of ethics                          | Collapse: no end-state needed or sought.                  |
| Justifying existence       | “Task that justifies existence” cited                         | Purpose disappears with the question.                     |

## 6. Conclusion

Ñāṇavīra accurately identifies how action forms identity and how the cosmos misreads vipāka. Yet he substitutes one teleology (cosmic rebirth) with another (ethical progression toward cessation). His arahant still speaks in value-driven terms—proof that structural exit remains hidden. To truly deteleologize *Kamma*, the machinery of value, purpose, and endpoint must be removed, not redirected.
