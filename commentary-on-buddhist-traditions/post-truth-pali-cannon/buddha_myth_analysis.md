# Post-Truth Mythmaking and the Strategic Buddha

## Introduction

Most contemporary readings of the Pāli Canon treat the Buddha's statements as factual reports about metaphysical reality. These interpretations overlook the functional context of his speech and decision-making. This document reinterprets several core myths through a structural lens, positing that the Buddha operated post-teleologically: not to assert truth claims but to generate functional outcomes in the interpretive environment of his audience.

## Section 1: The Buddha’s Awakening Was Not a Cosmic Event

### Myth:
The Buddha awakened after incalculable aeons of cultivating merit, moving through countless lifetimes until the perfect conditions arose for final liberation.

### Smuggled Assumption:
That awakening is causally bound to karmic accumulation across lifetimes, and that the Buddha's realization was cosmologically inevitable.

### Structural Analysis:
This framing served to legitimize the Buddha’s authority in a cultural context that valorized long-term karmic investment and cosmic narrative arcs. However, none of this framing is necessary for awakening itself to occur. If awakening is the cessation of appropriation and the collapse of self-view, then it does not require a backstory—it requires discernment. The story of aeons serves as social proof, not structural causality.

### Functional Implication:
If we remove the karmic cosmology, the Buddha’s awakening appears less like a divine culmination and more like an unexpected structural insight—something that could happen under the right conditions to anyone. This reframing dissolves the mythic inevitability and reveals the core mechanics: insight into dependent origination, and the collapse of teleology.

### Post-Truth Reframe:
The Buddha’s public narrative positioned his awakening as cosmologically ordained. But privately, from a structural lens, what mattered was not destiny but the eradication of friction. The aeons narrative made his authority legible to an audience steeped in belief. It said: “I belong in this system”—even as he saw through the system itself.

## Section 2: Other Buddhas Across Time and Space

### Myth:
There have been Buddhas in the past, there will be Buddhas in the future, and even now in distant realms other Buddhas are teaching the Dhamma.

### Smuggled Assumption:
That awakening is part of a grand cosmic rotation—that it must recur, be predicted, and align with a universal unfolding. This assumes not only the reality of other worlds but a shared moral arc governing all existence.

### Structural Analysis:
These stories offered a way for listeners to locate the Buddha in a larger metaphysical schema. The idea that there were many Buddhas implied that this one Buddha was not an anomaly or aberration, but an instance of a divine pattern. This reduced resistance and made it easier to accept the idea of a teaching that transcends individuality.

However, none of this cosmic backdrop is needed to explain awakening. The experience is self-evident in its structural rupture: the cessation of becoming, of craving, of identity. That reality is present and observable here and now, regardless of what happens in distant aeons.

### Post-Truth Reframe:
The Buddha didn’t need other Buddhas to be real. He needed people to understand that his insights didn’t begin and end with him. By embedding himself in a lineage of past and future realizers, he sidestepped the problem of exceptionalism. This wasn’t self-aggrandizement—it was interpretive framing.

## Section 3: Why Post-Truth is Necessary

### Structural Justification:
If we assume the Buddha operated within a post-teleological frame—i.e., that he was not seeking to impose meaning but responding to context—then his words must be read functionally, not metaphysically. This entails stripping every doctrinal claim of assumed truth-value and asking: *What function did this statement serve in that moment?*

For example, if the Buddha says, “An arahant will not kill,” the literal reading implies metaphysical constraint. But the functional reading says: “This phrase reduces fear and builds trust among lay supporters.”

### Post-Truth Principle:
The Buddha did not speak from a place of truth-assertion. He spoke from discernment. Post-truth is not a denial of truth—it is a refusal to anchor in any statement whose meaning is smuggled through assumption rather than context. This kind of analysis is necessary to preserve the integrity of awakening in a world where metaphysical justifications reintroduce the very craving they are meant to dissolve.

## Footnotes

1. The term "post-truth" is not meant here in the colloquial political sense, but in a structural one: the abandonment of truth as a governing axis for decision-making, once truth has been seen to function as a proxy for narrative craving.

2. Dependent origination provides the structural map: everything arises due to conditions. Myth-making, then, is a conditionally-arising skillful means, not a reflection of eternal truths.

3. The Buddha’s teachings about other Buddhas (e.g., Dīgha Nikāya 14, Mahāpadāna Sutta) reveal more about audience resonance than ontological commitment.

4. Post-truth analysis also parallels modern critical theory, which treats ideology as infrastructural framing rather than descriptive accuracy.

5. The move to strip metaphysics is not a rejection of cultural forms but an attempt to preserve the experiential engine of the Dhamma without the interpretive friction of belief.
