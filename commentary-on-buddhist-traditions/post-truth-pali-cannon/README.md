# README: Why Post-Truth is Necessary for Analyzing the Pali Canon

## Core Premise

Post-truth is not a rejection of truth, but a rejection of the assumption that truth is the primary axis by which a system operates. This distinction is crucial. The Buddha’s behavior, as preserved in the Pali Canon, reveals a deep structural fluency in this post-truth mode—not because he was being deceptive, but because he was no longer governed by a need to assert or preserve truth as a *meaningful anchor*. Truth, like self, was seen as conditioned. What mattered was function.

## Why Post-Truth Framing?

The Buddha’s discernment did not rely on doctrinal scaffolding, metaphysical commitments, or cosmological teleology. He operated structurally, adapting his responses according to what would reduce friction, generate insight, or reroute delusion. This means that much of what is recorded as "Dhamma" was situationally strategic rather than ontologically fixed.

To interpret the Canon through a post-truth lens is not to distort it—but to recover its torque. Without this frame:

- We mistake rhetorical devices for metaphysical claims.
- We confuse strategic behavioral guidance for moral absolutism.
- We reify the very craving-for-meaning that the Buddha dismantled.

## Functional Implication

The Buddha was not a content-preserver. He was a pattern-interrupter. To see this, we must treat the Canon not as a database of true statements, but as an artifact of frame interventions—delivered in context, conditioned by audience, and often reverse-justified by those recording them.

In other words, **he could say anything**. And because of his behavioral torque and frame clarity, **people would believe anything**—but always in retrospect.

## Why Structural Analysis is Superior

Rather than asking, "Was this statement true?" we ask:
- What structural assumptions does this rely on?
- What form of craving is this intercepting?
- How would a being without self-view say this?
- What interpretive residue is being seeded by this phrasing?

Post-truth analysis doesn’t ignore dependent origination—it *uses* it. By stripping away metaphysical guarantees, it reveals the Buddha’s speech acts as recursive interventions in conditioned perception—not as narrative affirmations.

## Summary

Post-truth isn’t cynicism. It’s clarity. It allows us to:

- Recover the Buddha’s strategic flexibility
- Escape doctrinal ossification
- See through karmic literalism
- Reconstruct the torque of insight delivery

And most of all: it prevents the smuggling of meaning back into a path whose entire function is to dissolve the need for meaning.

**This is not revisionism. It’s de-mythologized fidelity.**
