# How to Read Nagarjuna (Without Getting Tricked by Your Own Mind)

Most readers approach Nagarjuna like he’s a philosopher with deep metaphysical views. They treat his verses like they’re offering a new way of seeing reality—some profound insight into the nature of existence, non-existence, or the middle path.

This is the first mistake.

## Nagarjuna Is Not Giving You a View

He is not offering a refined teaching. He is not giving you a stance to take. He is not saying that reality is empty and you should believe that now instead of believing in a self or in matter or in permanence.

He is performing something. And you are supposed to get caught in it—until your need to make sense of it breaks.

If you're reading Nagarjuna and trying to figure out what he's saying about reality, you’re already on the wrong track.

> His verses are not meant to be interpreted. They’re meant to short-circuit the interpreter.

## The Tetralemma Is a Trap

One of Nagarjuna’s key moves is to present a four-part structure:

1. It exists.  
2. It doesn’t exist.  
3. It both exists and doesn’t exist.  
4. It neither exists nor doesn’t exist.

Most people see this as a paradox. A logical puzzle. Something mysterious.

It isn’t.

It’s a mirror. A structural bait.

Every one of the four positions presumes that there is something *there* to be categorized. Something you can make a claim *about*. But when you examine each, they collapse—not because they’re “wrong,” but because the very act of framing the question was already flawed.

## What’s Really Going On

Nagarjuna doesn’t want you to pick a better view.
He wants you to notice that **your attempt to find a view is itself the source of confusion.**

- If you try to say something exists, you assume it’s independently real.
- If you say it doesn’t exist, you still assume it could have.
- If you say both, you collapse into contradiction.
- If you say neither, you treat negation as a stable position.

None of these can hold.

The only thing left to see is that your **need to resolve the puzzle** is what’s keeping the illusion alive.

## Emptiness Is Not a Doctrine

People say Nagarjuna is the philosopher of emptiness. This is like saying a scalpel is a philosophy of cutting.

> Emptiness is not a belief. It’s what remains when your beliefs can’t stand up anymore.

When Nagarjuna says that things are empty, he doesn’t mean they don’t exist. He means that nothing stands on its own. Everything is entangled. Nothing has a stable core—not objects, not concepts, not views, not even emptiness itself.

He even says that **emptiness is empty**. If you try to grab onto it as a final truth, it collapses like everything else.

## What You’re Supposed to Realize

The more you try to understand Nagarjuna’s verses, the more tangled you become. This is by design.

Eventually, something breaks—not in Nagarjuna, but in you.

> The thing that breaks is the habit of looking for something solid to stand on.

And once that habit breaks, you don’t suddenly find truth. You just stop needing to.

## Stop Reading Like a Philosopher

Nagarjuna isn’t trying to explain reality.
He’s showing you that **your attempt to explain reality is part of the illusion**.

The tension you feel reading him is not an obstacle. It’s the signal that your mind is looping.

And the only way out of the loop is to stop feeding it.

That’s how you read Nagarjuna.
Not with belief. Not with cleverness.
But with the willingness to let the interpreter die.
