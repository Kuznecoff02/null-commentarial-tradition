# Why It Is Inappropriate to Call the Arahant a Person

When speaking about arahants, people often slip into the language of personhood. "He is a calm person," or "She is an awakened person." But this framing is not only inaccurate—it reintroduces the very delusion the arahant has uprooted. To describe an arahant as a person is to re-embed them within the structure of self-view they have seen through. It’s not just semantically off—it’s structurally incompatible.

## The Self-View That Defines Personhood

To call someone a person is to imply a persistent, stable agent—a self that owns experiences, makes decisions, and endures over time. Personhood smuggles in the idea of ownership: my thoughts, my actions, my life. It presumes the presence of a self that stands apart from the causal matrix and is affected by it.

But the arahant has seen through that illusion. Through the direct realization of dependent origination, they no longer perceive phenomena as being "for" a self. There is no sense of a controller behind the thoughts, no center of gravity around which experience orbits. Experience still arises, but it is not appropriated.

## The Arahant as a Systemic Participant

The arahant operates from within experience without implying identity. They are aware that the system is running, but they do not mistake themselves for a separate node within it. To borrow an analogy: imagine a character in a simulation who becomes aware of the simulation. The character continues to act within the game world, but without the delusion that they are autonomous or independent from the game's code. They no longer identify with the avatar. They see their movements as functions of causes and conditions.

This isn’t mystical or dissociative—it’s precise. The arahant doesn’t feel detached or robotic. On the contrary, their engagement with the world is immediate and unburdened, precisely because they no longer filter experience through the residue of self.

## First-Person View Without First-Person Ownership

People often assume that an absence of self-view would lead to some kind of depersonalized, zombie-like state. But this is projection. What disappears is not the ability to speak, move, or feel—it is the belief that there is a self at the center of those processes. The arahant still perceives the world, but the perception is not filtered through the assumption of being a someone.

It’s like playing a video game in first-person mode while being fully aware you are holding the controller. The field of vision doesn’t change—but the relationship to it does. There is perception, but no appropriation. Movement happens, but there is no doer.

## The Problem with Calling Them a "Person"

To call the arahant a person is to overwrite their frame with yours. It imposes a model of identity onto a structure that no longer runs on identity. It’s like labeling a mirror as a painting—it misses the entire function.

An arahant doesn't see themselves as a person. They see themselves as a node in a vast, interconnected system—a set of conditioned processes influencing and being influenced by other processes. There is no ownership, no ego, and no narrative arc tying it all together.

From their perspective, describing themselves as a person would be like a wave in the ocean insisting it’s a surfer. It’s not just wrong—it’s a category error.

## Conclusion

The term "person" implies a self. The arahant has seen through that illusion. To call them a person is to reintroduce the very thing they no longer believe in. Their actions are not personal. Their wisdom is not possessed. Their freedom is not about being someone who is free—it is about the complete dissolution of the someone.

The arahant doesn’t act from identity. They act from causes. They don’t resist reality. They move with it. And because of that, they can’t be said to be a person at all.

They are no one.

And that is why they are free.
