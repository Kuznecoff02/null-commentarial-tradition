**Title: The Identity Trap of Not Doing Techniques**

In some corners of the contemplative world, there’s a popular refrain: “Meditation isn’t about doing techniques.” It’s a valuable correction to the overmechanized, overbranded world of mindfulness exercises and spiritual routines. The idea is that liberation doesn’t arise from technique itself, but from insight into the nature of experience.

But then something strange happens.

The same people who say this begin to build an identity around *not* doing techniques. Their practice becomes a kind of anti-practice. The very thing they set out to reject—performing methods to get somewhere—is now being performed in reverse. They become the kind of person who doesn’t do techniques. The rejection itself becomes the method. And the identity.

You’ll hear statements like, “Real meditation is just being aware,” or “All those techniques are just distractions.” On the surface, this sounds like a helpful deconstruction. But underneath, there’s often a subtle signal: *I’m the kind of person who sees through technique.*

What started as an attempt to move away from appropriation has become a new form of appropriation.

The irony is structural, not personal. It’s not about hypocrisy. It’s about how the system of craving mutates. If one finds identity in technique, craving is alive. If one finds identity in rejecting technique, craving is still alive. The pressure hasn’t been removed—it’s just been rerouted.

The problem isn’t method or non-method. The problem is taking either one personally.

Freedom doesn’t care whether you follow a technique or not. It isn’t hidden in a meditation style. What matters is whether experience is being filtered through appropriation. That includes filtering it through an identity that says, “I’ve seen through it all.”

The moment you need to *be* the one who doesn’t do techniques, you’ve created a new kind of technique: one that functions by refusal, by negation. This is no different from clinging to a mantra or a breath. It is a structure of becoming.

Letting go of technique doesn’t mean adopting a posture of superiority. It means dropping the need to stabilize any position at all—*including* the one that claims to have gone beyond positions.

That’s the real technique: not holding onto anything. Not even the idea that you’ve let go.
