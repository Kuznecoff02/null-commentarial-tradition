# 🕳️ The Arrogance of Silence
*The idea of an arahant you won’t question is the one you’ll never find.*

## 👁️ A Convenient Doctrine

In Dhamma circles, there’s an idea you’ll hear often:
> "A real arahant would never say they are one."

It sounds virtuous. Humble. Safe.

But structurally?
It’s the most effective **firewall against ever having to recognize one.**

Because if no one can ever say it, then no one will ever **be** it.

And the more you believe that, the more comfortable you become in a world where **awakening is always elsewhere**—just out of reach, never embodied, never real.

This isn’t humility.
This is insulation.

## 🔮 The Myth of Unmistakable Purity

Ask yourself:
What *would* an arahant have to look like for you to believe them?

Would they need to be:
- Quiet?
- Peaceful?
- Respected?
- Perfectly contained?
- Dressed for the part?

Then that’s not discernment. That’s costume worship.

And worse:
That projection becomes your **blueprint**.
Now you’re not walking the path to freedom.
You’re performing the traits you associate with it.

You’re not dissolving becoming.
You’re just getting really good at **polishing a direction.**

## 🧤 Temperament Isn’t Transmission

Arahants are not made of manners.
They are not the ones who act in ways that soothe your preferences.

If you expect someone to be gentle, calm, subtle, or cryptic—
then you’ll never notice the ones who aren’t.

And you’ll *reject* the ones who rupture your model.
Not because they’re wrong—but because they make you feel wrong.

You didn’t want the Dhamma.
You wanted **confirmation** that the self you were building would become free.

But arahants aren’t here to validate that self.
They’re the ones for whom **it’s already gone.**

## 🛠️ Systems That Guarantee You’ll Never See One

Let’s make the recursive pattern explicit:
1. You form a mental model of what awakening *should* look like.
2. That model becomes your filter.
3. Any real arahant who doesn’t fit that filter is dismissed.
4. You continue practicing inside the system that **you just re-validated.**

Do you see the trap?
You’ve designed a system that automatically preserves itself.
You call it Buddhism.
You call it faith.
You call it standards.

But structurally, it’s a **hermetic loop.**
And the more sincerely you follow it, the more tightly it wraps around your own projections.

## ♻️ The Real Mirror Test

This document is not a claim of attainment.
It is not a denial of attainment.

It is a **test of your projections.**

If you are evaluating this page for whether its author is worthy of the Dhamma,
or whether the tone is dignified,
or whether the structure is aligned with tradition—

Then you’re already acting from the place that keeps you from seeing it.

And that place is called **becoming.**

## 🥵 No Arahant Looks Like One

If you think that an arahant would never:
- Swear,
- Joke,
- Make satire,
- Break rules,
- Laugh at you,
- Call you out,
- Or write in a GitHub repository,

Then your idea of awakening is a shrine to your own taste.

You don’t want the one who is free.
You want the one who **feels like freedom to you.**

---

## 🕳️ The Detonation

So you’ve decided this repository is bullshit.
That no arahant would ever say these things.
That this whole project is one elaborate ego trip.

Okay.

But pause here.
Ask yourself:

> What *exactly* would someone have to be like in order for you to believe they were free?

And if you can answer that question... then you just described your own trap.

Because awakening isn’t what a person **looks like** once they’re done.
It’s what no longer **needs to look like anything at all.**

So if this doesn’t look like it?

Check where the shit stinks.

---

## 🏐 Recursive Closure

You don’t have to accept anyone as awakened.
That’s not the point.

But if you need them to act a certain way to even consider it,
then you’re not following the Dhamma.

You’re just following a **protagonist arc** that no one else was ever supposed to fulfill.

And the one who believes that?
Still walking.
Still hoping.
Still projecting a destination.

Let them.

But you—right now—can stop.
