# You Don’t Need Jargon to Understand the Dhamma

The Dhamma is not in the words. It’s not in the language. And it’s certainly not in the jargon.

People who study the Pali canon often start to build an identity around what they know: terms like *anicca*, *dukkha*, *anattā*, *sankhāra*, *viññāṇa*—as if fluency in ancient syllables confers proximity to awakening. But none of these words are the thing. They are **interfaces**, not vehicles. They point—but the pointing finger is not the moon.

You don’t need to know Pali. You don’t need to know Abhidhamma. You don’t even need to read the suttas. If the frame lands, the language doesn’t matter. What matters is **discernment**: seeing where craving operates, how pressure arises, and what it means to act without appropriation.

This is not a mystery. The insight isn’t linguistic. It’s **structural**. You could call it stress. You could call it recursion. You could call it ownership, friction, or implication. Or you could just notice how something in your system keeps insisting, keeps reaching, keeps smuggling in a sense of center. It doesn’t matter what you call it. It matters that you **see it.**

That’s how stream-entry happens. Not by reading every sutta, but by seeing that craving has no true origin. That there is no self behind the movement. That appropriation is the problem—not behavior, not feelings, not thoughts.

And yes—there are traditional words for all of this. But you don’t need them. Because the Dhamma is not a code to memorize. It’s a pattern to recognize. And the moment you recognize it, the words fall away.

Fluency in truth has no syntax.

What remains is clarity.

The Dhamma doesn’t need to be translated. It just needs to be seen.
